1,3,Moreover _comma_ the essentially model theoretic slant on specification we propose here seems particularly well suited to this aim .
2,3,One can notice a slight difference in the results obtained over the lexicon and the corpus .
3,5,Operators like only and so-called `` focussed negation then combine the extracted element of the interpretation with what was left behind to carry complex messages of the kind discussed above .
4,3,We then review the theoretical and computational tools available for mapping from fragments of sentences to fully scoped semantic representations .
5,5,Kameyama 1986 has proposed another extension to the Grosz et al. 1986 theory - a property-sharing constraint which attempts to enforce a parallellism between entities in successive utterances .
6,3,As it is unclear how to estimate  directly _comma_ we apply Bayes 's Rule and get
7,3,selects appropriate evidence to justify the system 's proposed modification of the user 's beliefs _comma_ and
8,3,When such a set of conditions is met _comma_ that inference is drawn _comma_ but it is assigned a defeasible status .
9,5,where  is the length of the description of the grammar in bits .
10,5,Taken for themselves these variants of L are of little use in linguistic descriptions .
11,3,We describe the heuristic measures used and their combination scheme .
12,3,Finally a partial implementation of these ideas is presented _comma_ along with some preliminary results from testing on a small set of sentences .
13,7,In subsection  we defend the use of a broad-coverage taxonomy .
14,3,Then we would want the two objects corresponding to the interpretation of ate a peach to be something like :
15,3,There can be topic shifts without change of initiation _comma_ change of control without a topic shift Whittaker and Stenton 1988 .
16,5,Phonologists usually describe a pitch contour much as they describe speech more generally _comma_ namely as a sequence of discrete units ( i.e. a transcription ) .
17,3,The semantics for this embedded sentence is the open proposition that the two clauses share .
18,3,If the thread currently being followed is among the highest rated threads _comma_ this thread is continued .
19,3,The proposal for dealing with re-entrancy is less satisfactory but offers a basis for empirical exploration _comma_ and has definite advantages over the straightforward use of PCFGs .
20,3,Perhaps what is needed is a `` similarity measure '' between two models M and M ' _comma_ such that if a corpus were tagged with model M _comma_ M ' is the model obtained by training from the output corpus from the tagger as if it were a hand-tagged corpus .
21,3,But as far as we have no confusion _comma_ we omit role name ` observed ' henceforth .
22,3,However _comma_ in order to disambiguate the tag and place the subject markers it is only necessary to know that it is a noun or else a verb .
23,6,Our off-line compiler extends the techniques developed in the context of the DIA in that it compiles typed feature structure grammars _comma_ rather than simple logic grammars .
24,5,MLE _comma_ as its name suggests _comma_ selects a model which maximizes the likelihood of the data _comma_ that is _comma_  .
25,3,Both texts contained approximately 10_comma_000 words and were tagged using an English resp .
26,6,Complete details of this example and of the model are given by Edmonds 1993 .
27,3,For each interpretation I _comma_ each object u in I and each feature structure F _comma_ [ F is true of u under I iff some resolvant of F is true of u under I .
28,3,However _comma_ from the F  data for the above utterances we can hypothesise the behaviour of these unseen sequences _comma_ and this can be tested in subsequent empirical work .
29,3,This is precisely the kind of structural constraint that is designed to specify .
30,3,Our actual work addresses more the problems inside each module .
31,4,Agent A must adopt agent B 's goals as her own .
32,3,Anaphoric expressions in the semantics are independently referential and are resolved through purely semantic means regardless of the type of discourse inference .
33,3,In the present context _comma_ say for a sequence of 20 tones _comma_ the search space contains  possible tone transcriptions _comma_ and for each of these there are thousands of possible parameter settings _comma_ too large a search space for exhaustive search in a reasonable amount of computation time .
34,5,Its inclusion violates the rule of Don't tell people facts that they already know .
35,3,For example _comma_ given an input of 3 nps _comma_ the parser will happily create a state expecting 3 nps to the left .
36,4,Rhetorical structure represents relations between various chunks of sentences in the body of each section .
37,4,SRs can be seen as semantic type constraints that a word sense imposes on the words with which it combines in the process of semantic interpretation .
38,3,The outline of procedures to acquire the collocational information is as follows :
39,1,The discussion so far should have given the reader some idea of how to specify LFG grammars using  .
40,1,We also describe a method to acquire the collocational information from a corpus of four kanzi character words .
41,5,Call this new node X _comma_ and call the path traversed to reach it p .
42,2,In  _comma_ each conjunct contains different numbers of modifiers of different types ( an adverbial phrase with two prepositional phrases ) .
43,3,(B1) EFFECTIVENESS :
44,7,In this section _comma_ I present experimental results using a more rigorous evaluation methodology .
45,3,positional ( like in )
46,3,In  _comma_ the noun phrase headed by otona `` adult '' is judged to be prescriptive _comma_ as it is the complement of the copular naru `` become '' .
47,3,We show how lexical functions can be thought to reflect cross-linguistic meaning concepts for collocational structures and their translational equivalents _comma_ and therefore suggest themselves as some kind of language-independent semantic primitives from which translation strategies can be developed .
48,3,For example _comma_ the English sentence  :
49,3,Some denote a change of position which always occur ( voyager-to travel ) .
50,7,In this section we review the relevant facts for two such forms of ellipsis _comma_ namely gapping and VP-ellipsis _comma_ and also compare these with facts concerning non-elliptical event reference .
51,1,This paper presents a new experimental method for determining whether a discourse strategy is effective and presents experimental results on a strategy for supporting deliberation .
52,3,As an example of how these figures relate to overall accuracies _comma_ LOB-B contains 32.35 % ambiguous tokens with respect to the lexicon from LOB-B-J _comma_ and the overall accuracy in the D0+T0 case is hence 98.69 % .
53,3,While we have used bigrams as an easily-accessible platform to develop and test the model _comma_ more substantial improvements might be obtainable for more informative configurations .
54,3,Then we shift our attention to more microscopic one _comma_ in which _comma_ roughly speaking _comma_ the important part of semantics of complex sentence is formalized as relations among semantic roles that appear in the main clause or the subordinate clause .
55,3,More specifically _comma_ the constraints applied in creating islands are such that islands do not have to be adjacent _comma_ but may be separated by non-covered input .
56,3,The key idea underlying our approach is to think about LFG model theoretically .
57,3,The ambiguity types resolved by this model are analysed and compared to ambiguity types of English and French .
58,2,For example _comma_ consider the ambiguous sentence _comma_
59,3,Note that we allow the input to be a full FSA ( possibly including cycles _comma_ etc. ) since some of the above-mentioned techniques indeed result in cycles .
60,5,Brill et al. 1990 try to infer grammatical category from bigram statistics .
61,3,We wish to exploit these constraints .
62,3,the evaluation of the accuracy of the rhetorical structure analysis carried out previously Sumita 1992 showed 74 % .

65,2,Recently _comma_ Murata and Nagao 1993 have proposed a method of determining the referentiality property and number of nouns in Japanese sentences for machine translation into English _comma_ but the research has not yet been extended to include the actual English generation .
66,3,The only extra work we have to perform is that we have to find somewhere to put the interpretation of the focussed item itself .
67,3,The unacceptability of these examples suggests that word by word identity is insufficient _comma_ and that deleted material must have identical syntactic structure _comma_ as well as identical lexical meanings .
68,3,If we mirror the Japanese bracketing structure in English to form the initial TNCB _comma_ we obtain : ( ( book the ) ( red is ) ) .
69,3,In this case _comma_ the anaphoric expression is constrained to have the same semantics as the copied constituent .
70,3,For simple tenses  is the speech time _comma_ and therefore simple tenses are not anaphoric .
71,4,Recognizing the structure of text is an essential task in text understanding Grosz and Sidner 1986 .
72,3,Table  lists the possible temporal relations between the eventualities described by two consecutive sentences without temporal expressions or cue words _comma_ where the first sentence ( S ) may have any tense and aspect and the second sentence ( S ) expresses a simple past event .
73,4,Vowel and Diacritic Shifts
74,3,The over-generalization seems to be produced because of little difference in the nouns included in the rival classes .
75,3,B may not think that p is relevant _comma_
76,3,Alternatively _comma_ the anaphoric expression could be resolved purely semantically _comma_ resulting in the discharge of the anaphoric assumption P .
77,4,There is a well-known debate in psycholinguistics concerning the bilingual mental representation : independence position assumes that bilingual memory is represented by two functionally independent storage and retrieval systems _comma_ whereas interdependence position hypothesizes that all information of languages exists in a common memory store .
78,6,We used the SPSS system for statistical data analysis _comma_ which has as one of its features a complete discriminant analysis SPSS 1990 .
79,3,An outside-in quantifier scoping algorithm based on Lewin 1990 .
80,5,Distituency is marked by a mutual information minima .
81,3,Further research applying the same techniques to a broader set of data should establish the generality of the control rules suggested here .
82,3,The inconclusive nature of the results obtained was due to a number of limiting factors of the implementation including the simplicity of the grammar and the lack of available data .
83,3,It will take a sentence _comma_ locate the subject and then find the head of the subject .
84,3,In example  the fact that the key is mentioned only in the second sentence of links with the second thread .
85,6,We refine our previous analysis to account for cases where an f-structure is reached by multiple paths from an enclosing f-structure .
86,4,The sentence in  usually has the logical form ( LF ) in .
87,3,Tag induction fails for cardinals ( for the reasons mentioned above ) and for `` - ing '' forms .
88,6,In order to represent grammar rules distributively _comma_ we adopt categorial grammar _comma_ where we can an attach local grammar rule to each word and phrase .
89,3,Tests  a show two more heuristic methods for determining whether a noun phrase has generic reference .
90,3,The premise of R is obvously not only Q but both P and Q .
91,5,Ebobisse 1989 grouped the Sawabantu languages of Cameroon by whether phonological correspondences in matching vocabulary items were complete _comma_ partial _comma_ or lacking .
92,5,This would then be reduced by the clauses for apply to result in  .
93,5,Heeman and Hirst 1992 rendered Clark and Wilkes-Gibbs 's model computationally by casting it into the planning paradigm .
94,3,Therefore unlike the `` garu / gat-ta '' case _comma_ the experiencer also can be an obligatory semantic role of higher clause as well as the speaker .
95,5,The enhanced dialogue model has four levels : the domain level which consists of the domain plan being constructed for the user 's later execution _comma_ the problem-solving level which contains the actions being performed to construct the domain plan _comma_ the belief level which consists of the mutual beliefs pursued during the planning process in order to further the problem-solving intentions _comma_ and the discourse level which contains the communicative actions initiated to achieve the mutual beliefs Chu-Carroll and Carberry 1994 .
96,3,If this is the case _comma_ it might be highly misguided to attempt to capture  using a logical specification language .
97,3,harry would get type-raised by the raise clause to produce  _comma_ and then composed with found _comma_ with the result shown in the following query :
98,3,Note that the feature structure at the root of a PLPATR derivation tree will not involve re-entrancy .
99,3,We estimate that if referentiality could be determined 100 % correctly then the percentage of noun phrases with correctly generated articles and number could be improved to 96 % in the test set we studied .
100,2,We empirically compared the performance of our method based on the MDL Principle against the Maximum Likelihood Estimator in word clustering _comma_ and found that the former outperforms the latter .
101,3,To test its feasibility _comma_ this computational model is implemented in a system called PROVERB .
102,4,Let 's assume that the latter relation is stated by pairs of trees .
103,5,For example _comma_ the two conjuncts in  share the feature +MANNER .
104,5,locations which are concrete places ( a room ; a house ; a street ) ;
105,3,The literature on ellipsis and event reference is voluminous _comma_ and so we will not attempt a comprehensive comparison here .
106,3,N to
107,5,In their approach _comma_ word boundaries are identified through purely statistical information ( the HMM model ) without regarding such linguistic knowledge _comma_ as dictionaries .
108,3,Although the grammar is linked to a lexicon containing definitions for 40000 base forms of words _comma_ the experiments draw on a much smaller lexicon of 600 words ( consisting of closed class vocabulary and _comma_ for open-class vocabulary _comma_ definitions of just a sample of words which taken together exhibit the full range of possible complementation patterns ) _comma_ since issues of lexical coverage are of no concern here .
109,3,We also recommended using an underspecified representation of temporal / rhetorical structure to avoid generating all solutions until higher-level knowledge can aid in reducing ambiguity .
110,3,Since the final state c  matches the state immediately before the conjunction _comma_ the two strings can combine .
111,5,A second indirect way of signalling discourse structure is intonation .
112,2,They assumed compound nouns consist of only one character words and two character words .
113,3,For instance _comma_ the word danses ( the plural of the noun danse or a second person form of the verb danser ( to dance ) has the following analyses :
114,2,There has been no method proposed to date _comma_ however _comma_ that learns dependencies between case slots in the natural language processing literature .
115,4,In some cases information from the corrected material is incorporated into the final message .
116,6,The results we report here are obtained using an implementation written in Common Lisp that uses Screamer Siskind and McAllester 1993 _comma_ a macro package that provides nondeterministic constructs .
117,4,One widely used approach makes use of a statistical technique called a Hidden Markov Model ( HMM ) .
118,3,LHIP provides a processing method which allows selected portions of the input to be ignored or handled differently .
119,3,These were prompts _comma_ repetitions and summaries .
120,3,Succeeds if the input S can be parsed as an instance of category C .
121,3,MIS is different from mutual information because MIS takes account of the position of the word ( left / right ) .
122,3,This predicts that any substring of a sentence can coordinate with itself _comma_ and hence that any substring of a sentence can act as a conjunct .
123,3,When agglomerative clustering of phonetic string comparison distances is applied to Gaelic _comma_ reasonable dialect boundaries are obtained _comma_ corresponding to national and ( within Ireland ) provincial boundaries .
124,5,For slot-based models _comma_ with the independence assumption _comma_ the following probabilities .
125,5,Elsewhere we show that
126,3,As each root does not occur in all vocalisms and patterns _comma_ each lexical entry is associated with a feature structure which indicates inter alia the possible patterns and vocalisms for a particular root .
127,3,The rhetorical structure also provides the rhetorical relation between the extracted sentences _comma_ and can be used to generate appropriate connectives between them .
128,5,In a dynamic grammar _comma_ any substring of a sentence can be assigned a type .
129,2,Furthermore _comma_ it lends itself readily to an extension for the intensional verb case that has advantages over the widely-assumed account of Partee and Rooth 1983 .
130,3,This appendix contains an example of a tagged corpus .
131,5,Based on this calculation the algorithm constructs the dependency forest shown in Figure  _comma_ because the mutual information between and _comma_ and are large enough _comma_ but not the others .
132,3,the conjunction clause is searched for before either of the two s clauses ;
133,3,can elaborate on if describes an event _comma_ or
134,3,Each simulation was scored for the number of correct segmentation points inserted _comma_ as compared to the natural English segmentation .
135,5,It is also common to find interruptions requesting extra clarification _comma_ or disagreements before the end of a sentence .
136,3,This work has principally been developed on text of technical manuals from Perkins Engines Ltd. _comma_ which have been translated by a semi-automatic process Pym 1993 .
137,3,However _comma_ the overall form of the model  does not depend on this assumption _comma_ and we will next investigate an estimate for derived by averaging estimates for the conditional probabilities that follows words that are distributionally similar to .
138,3,Thus we shall proceed as follows .
139,3,This conclusion is independent of the choice of the element  .
140,3,There are a number of reasons for choosing the Brown Corpus data for training .
141,4,Although the usefulness of on-line semantic filtering during the processing of complete sentences is debatable _comma_ filtering has a more plausible role to play in interactive _comma_ real-time environments _comma_ such as interactive spell checkers ( see e.g. Wirn 1990 for arguments for incremental parsing in such environments ) .
142,5,This process continues until the expression _comma_ kept in the participants ' common ground _comma_ is mutually accepted .
143,3,Thirdly _comma_ the distribution of interruptions and summaries differs across dialogue types .
144,3,Morphophonological interactions may be quite complex _comma_ and the purpose of morphological processing is to derive syntactic and semantic analyses from words and vice versa for the purpose of full NLP. Reasonably quick compilation is required _comma_ and run-time speed need only be moderate .
145,3,The analysis suggests that discourse participants often mutually agree to a change of topic .
146,3,In source clauses of gapping constructions _comma_ constituents in the source that are parallel to the overt constituents in the target are abstracted out of the clause representation .
147,5,If on the other hand we assume that the random variables are independent _comma_ we only need to calculate and compare Li and Abe 1995 .
148,3,Given the correspondence between the definitions of a PTH and a PCFG it should be apparent that the training methods which apply to one can equally be used with the other .
149,4,In information-theoretic terms _comma_ the number of decisions required is smaller _comma_ and hence the tagger need contribute less information to make the decisions .
150,3,The spelling pattern 194 referred to here is the one depicted in a different form in Figure  .
151,5,The two taggers have the same tokeniser and morphological analyser .
152,3,In the first experiment we tagged the text with the Brown Corpus lexicon supplied with the taggers and hence had only those unknown words which naturally occur in this text .
153,3,The transfer module maps  onto which is then synthesised by the French module to .
154,3,Roughly speaking _comma_ the f-terminator of a node is the node from which it gets the value for the feature f. Because of the constraints on the form of PLPATR productions _comma_ the derivations between the root of  and these terminators cannot in general depend on more than a bounded part of the feature structures and .
155,2,The problem with these approaches is that they assign a dual life to pragmatic inferences : in the initial stage _comma_ as members of a simple or complex utterance _comma_ they are defeasible .
156,2,This distinguishes this account from others that assume either that utterance actions always succeed or that they succeed unless the addressee previously believed otherwise Litman and Allen 1990 _comma_ Grosz and Sidner 1990 .
157,3,Of course _comma_ sometimes it is possible to take advantage of certain cue words which either indicate or constrain the rhetorical relation .
158,3,The first point to note is that the examples here are only a subset of the types of IRU 's that occur in dialogues .
159,3,The second problem is that all non-unit clauses of the program are added to the chart .
160,5,These formulas manipulate basic assertions of the form  _comma_ for f-structures f and meaning logic terms M .
161,3,So a mutual belief supported as an inference can get defeated by linguistic information .
162,3,But it remains to be seen how readily the equations used for ellipsis here can be integrated into Pulman 's framework .
163,3,Since the number of parameters that exist in a multi-dimensional joint distribution is exponential if we allow n-ary dependencies in general _comma_ it is infeasible to estimate them with high accuracy with a data size available in practice .
164,3,Rather it is a constraint on the actions that the agent may plan to do .
165,3,If  is computable then for some effective function _comma_ for each feature structure F _comma_ [ a list of the resolvants of F .
166,5,As another example _comma_ certain techniques to deal with ill-formed input can be characterized as finite state transducers Lang 1989 ; the composition of an input string with such a finite state transducer results in a FSA that can then be input for syntactic parsing .
167,2,Research to date has focused on determining to which of these sources infants might be sensitive _comma_ but little work has been done to determine the potential usefulness of each source .
168,3,so the abstract does not contain fragmentary sentences which cannot be understood alone .
169,5,Some of the future lines of research outlined above have been already investigated and their results included in Ribas 1994a .
170,3,There is no reason why clustering sentences for prediction should not be combined with clustering words to reduce sparseness ; the two operations are orthogonal .
171,5,As an illustration of how the semantic rules can be simulated in first-order unification _comma_ consider the derivation of the constituent harry found _comma_ where harry has the category np with LF harry ' and found is a transitive verb of category  with LF
172,3,forall and exists are encoded similarly to abstraction _comma_ in that they take a functional argument and so object-level binding of variables by quantifiers is handled by meta-level  - abstraction .
173,4,In this example _comma_ one of the possible accounts for this interpretation is the following .
174,4,We are specially interested on SRs _comma_ which can be expressed as semantic type constraints that a word sense imposes on the words with which it combines in the process of semantic interpretation .
175,3,It remains to be seen how bottom-up Earley deduction compares with ( and can be combined with ) the improved top-down Earley deduction of Doerre 1993 _comma_ Johnson 1993 and Neumann forthcoming _comma_ and to head-driven methods with well-formed substring tables Bouma and van Noord 1993 _comma_ and which methods are best suited for which kinds of problems ( e.g. parsing _comma_ generation _comma_ noisy input _comma_ incremental processing etc . )
176,3,In the parse-forest grammar _comma_ complex symbols are non-terminals _comma_ atomic symbols are terminals .
177,3,Both occurrences are miscategorized _comma_ since its context vectors do not provide enough evidence for the verbal use .
178,3,In terms of ambiguity rates _comma_ the English _comma_ French _comma_ and German texts are thus quite comparable .
179,5,We concentrate here _comma_ however _comma_ on just one part of that system _comma_ the discourse actor which drives the actions of the dialogue manager module .
180,5,This undecidability result is usually circumvented by considering subsets of DCGs which can be recognized effectively .
181,3,There are two competing goals of incremental generation for spoken output _comma_ that must be taken into account when estimating the usefulness of defaults :
182,4,The wealth of literature on tone and intonation has amply demonstrated that voice pitch ( F  ) in speech is under independent linguistic control .
183,5,For example _comma_ if X is a unary function _comma_ then the semantic rule is  _comma_ and if the functions have two arguments _comma_ then the rule is .
184,3,Her example which we reproduce in figure  can also be accounted for using the continuing / retaining distinction .
185,1,The paper describes a parser for Categorial Grammar which provides fully word by word incremental interpretation .
186,3,In Tables  - _comma_ we summarize our results .
187,3,If steps  and attempt to place conflicting values in the RHET_RELN slot _comma_ the parse will fail .
188,3,decomposition of complex utterances through recursive linguistic structure .
189,7,This section shows the application of the similarity between words to text analysis -- measuring similarity between texts _comma_ and measuring text coherence .
190,3,Here ` 0 ' indicates the absence of the case slot in question .
191,2,On the other hand _comma_ conventional knowledge or script-based abstract generation systems Lehnert 1980 _comma_ Fum 1986 _comma_ owe their success to the limitation of the domain _comma_ and cannot be applied to document with varied subjects _comma_ such as popular scientific magazine .
192,3,The limitations of the system are mainly due to errors in the rhetorical structure analysis and the sentence-selection-type abstract generation .
193,4,The analysis of temporal expressions in natural language discourse provides a challenge for contemporary semantic theories .
194,1,We propose an extension to these states which handles some additional cases of multiple ambiguous pronouns .
195,1,We propose a new formalism _comma_ called `` stratified logic '' _comma_ that correctly handles the pragmatic inferences _comma_ and we start by giving a very brief introduction to the main ideas that underlie it .
196,3,We begin with a version of the interpretation which lacks a treatment of re-entrant feature structures _comma_ then provide an extended interpretation which allows them .
197,3,Note that we use garu as a value of the relation feature meant by ` rel ' .
198,3,is a set _comma_
199,5,Merialdo 's conclusion is that taggers should be trained using as much hand-tagged text as possible to begin with _comma_ and only then applying BW re-estimation with untagged text .
200,3,Preference judgement selects the structure candidate with the lowest penalty score _comma_ a value determined based on preference rules on every two neighboring relations in the candidate .
201,3,The likelihood for this to happen by chance decreases drastically with increased rule length .
202,5,A link marking can be removed if the linked categories resp. the linked semantic forms are identical ( rule local-success ) .
203,3,We are aware that this ranking usually coincides with surface constituent order in English .
204,3,A possible characterisation of total vs. partial downstep now arises : if  then we have total downstep _comma_ but if then we have partial downstep .
205,3,To find the most probable parse for a sentence _comma_ we simply find the path from word to word which maximizes the product of the state transitions ( as we have a first order Markov process ) .
206,3,Corpus LOB-B-J was used to train the model _comma_ and LOB-B _comma_ LOB-L and LOB-B-G were passed through thirty iterations of the BW algorithm as untagged data .
207,3,Secondly _comma_ any corpus of text usually contains only those errors that were left undetected in the text .
208,3,Firstly _comma_ for each word type in the corpus we can collect the transitions with which it occurs and calculate its probability distribution over all possible transitions ( an infinite number of which will be zero ) .
209,3,Now for the satisfaction definition .
210,4,On the basis of the usefulness of probabilistic context-free grammars Charniak 1993 _comma_ it is plausible to assume that that the extension of probabilistic techniques to such structures will allow the application of known and new techniques of parse ranking and grammar induction to more interesting grammars than has hitherto been the case .
211,5,Cuv 1951 felt that there can be no dialect boundaries because transitions are gradual .
212,3,Candidate generation generates all possible rhetorical structures described by binary trees which do not violate segmentation restrictions .
213,3,The existence of a collocation function is established during analysis .
214,7,In this section _comma_ we consider a heuristic for producing a motivated guess for the initial TNCB .
215,3,The simplicity of the Design-World task means that its structure is a subcomponent of many other tasks .
216,1,not requiring greater than second-order matching for dealing with quantifiers .
217,3,The percent of successes that both algorithms get indicates that syntax has a strong influence _comma_ and that at the very least we can reduce the amount of inference required .
218,3,As an example _comma_ the sentence the woman stole a bike is interpreted as
219,3,This rule is represented in the grammar as a part of the description of subcategorization frames for verbs .
220,3,I 'm also indebted to Michael Berry for SVDPACK and to the Penn Treebank Project for the parsed Brown corpus .
221,3,Step 2 .
222,3,This second step replaces the use of the independence assumption in the original back-off model .
223,2,However _comma_ since conventional word-frequency-based abstract generation systems Kuhn 1958 are lacking in inter-sentential or discourse-structural analysis _comma_ they are liable to generate incoherent abstracts .
224,3,In this paper _comma_ we call a member of a noun partition a ` noun cluster _comma_ ' and a member of a verb partition a ` verb cluster ' .
225,3,Suppose that we generalize LIG to allow the stack to be passed from the mother to two daughters .
226,6,Memoization and reuse of partial results
227,3,This separation allows for an analysis in DRT of temporal subordinate clauses in quantified sentences _comma_ which avoids Partee 's problem altogether .
228,3,Unless grammar size takes on proportionately much more significance for such longer inputs _comma_ which seems implausible _comma_ it appears that in fact the major problems do not lie in the area of grammar size _comma_ but in input length .

236,1,In this paper we present a formalization of the centering approach to modeling attentional structure in discourse and use it as the basis for an algorithm to track discourse context and bind pronouns .
237,4,By ` dependency ' is meant the relation that exists between case slots which constrains the possible values assumed by each of those case slots .
238,3,Our solution to these problems is the application of a singular value decomposition .
239,4,The ( context-free ) grammar defining this intersection is simply constructed by keeping track of the state names in the non-terminal category symbols .
240,5,A discourse module might combine theories on _comma_ e.g. _comma_ centering or local focusing Grosz et al. 1983 _comma_ Sidner 1979 _comma_ global focus Grosz 1977 _comma_ coherence relations Hobbs 1985 _comma_ event reference Webber 1986 _comma_ intonational structure Pierrehumbert and Hirschberg 1990 _comma_ system vs. user beliefs Pollack 1986 _comma_ plan or intent recognition or production Cohen 1978 _comma_ Allen and Perrault 1980 _comma_ Sidner and Israel 1981 _comma_ control Whittaker and Stenton 1988 _comma_ or complex syntactic structures Prince 1985 .
241,3,We distinguish 4 categories on the basis of which kind of `` location '' they intrinsically refer to .
242,3,This means that we do not need externally-given grammar rules but those rules reside within each word or each phrase .
243,3,By bringing filtering into the logic underlying the grammar it is possible to show in a perspicuous and logically clean way how and why filtering can be optimized in a particular fashion and how various approaches relate to each other .
244,5,This constraint is imposed only to require that the second clause contain the past perfect instead of the simple past .

250,3,It consists of two parts _comma_ the constraint-based portion and the preference-based portion :
251,3,and so M from the original query is
252,3,It has been often noted Halliday and Hasan 1976 _comma_ inter alia _comma_ that it is the main verb do that is operative in these forms of anaphora _comma_ in contrast to the auxiliary do operative in VP-ellipsis .
253,4,The resulting sense groupings should be useful for a variety of purposes _comma_ although ultimately this work is motivated by the goal of sense disambiguation for unrestricted text using unsupervised methods .

267,3,It is familiar from the psycholinguistic literature that there is a preference for attaching the with phrase as an instrumental argument of the verb ( as in  ) _comma_ on the reading where the telescope is the instrument of seeing ) .
268,3,This technique does not require specially prepared training data and employs fully unsupervised statistical learning using the lexicon supplied with the tagger and word-frequencies obtained from a raw corpus .
269,3,A closer look reveals that many clusters embody finer distinctions .
270,3,As we noted in the last paragraph _comma_ it is the nature of parsing incrementally that we don't know what words are to come next .
271,4,The design of an appropriate tagset is subject to both external and internal criteria .
272,4,Here the choice is between whether or not to have semantic filtering at all _comma_ rather than whether to do it on-line _comma_ or at the end of the sentence .
273,1,We present some variations affecting the association measure and thresholding on a technique for learning Selectional Restrictions from on-line corpora .

279,3,As a first experiment _comma_ we used our method to classify the 64 nouns appearing most frequently as heads of direct objects of the verb `` fire '' in one year ( 1988 ) of Associated Press newswire .
280,3,Observe the symmetries in this table .
281,5,For instance _comma_ they are categorized by the degree of possibilities of coreference between zero pronouns inside the subordinate clause and nominal or topic that appear in the main clause .
282,3,As a result of this _comma_ we obtain both noun clusters and verb clusters .
283,3,However _comma_ they may yet re-emerge in the model under a different guise _comma_ as we shall see later .
284,3,Our experimental results indicate that for some classes of verbs the accuracy achieved in a disambiguation experiment can be improved by using the acquired knowledge of dependencies between case slots .
285,5,In principle _comma_ origin words can be freely chosen .

287,2,The reason is that there are now two sources of recursion : in the DCG and in the FSA ( cycles ) .
288,3,The first experiment suggests that initial biasing of either lexical or transition probabilities is essential to achieve a good accuracy .
289,3,However _comma_ a significant portion of these sentences ( 23 out of the 58 ) return with bad parses _comma_ due to the skipping of essential words of the input .
290,5,The dialogue manager is responsible for maintaining the flow of conversation and making sure that the conversational goals are met .
291,4,Data sparseness is an inherent problem in statistical methods for natural language processing .

293,5,Otherwise traverse the surface parse trees of previous sentences in the text in reverse chronological order until an acceptable antecedent is found ; each tree is traversed in a left-to-right _comma_ breadth-first manner _comma_ and when an NP node is encountered _comma_ it is proposed as the antecedent .
294,2,In the following _comma_ we will present shortly a semantic representation formalism and a corresponding set of analysis rules which resist to the definition of ` semantic head ' as it is required in van Noord 's head-corner algorithm .
295,3,Devising optimal tagsets for given tasks is a field in which further work is planned .
296,4,In such cases _comma_ collaborative agents should attempt to square away Joshi 1982 the conflicts by engaging in collaborative negotiation to determine what should constitute their shared plan of actions and shared beliefs .
297,3,This says that the relationship simple holds between some past instant A and the property of being a certain sort of event .

304,3,Finally the problem of how to determine obligatory / optional cases based on dependencies acquired from data should also be addressed .
305,2,The problem for practical systems is twofold : we could assume that in the case of narrative the Kamp / Hinrichs / Partee algorithm is the default _comma_ but each time the default is applied we would need to check all our available world knowledge to see whether there isn't a world knowledge postulate which might be overriding this assumption .
306,3,We will identify an occurrence of an f-structure with a path ( from the root ) to that occurrence ; sets of occurrences of an f-structure can therefore be identified with path sets in the f-structure .
307,3,Now suppose that  is such an X .
308,1,We describe a method for analysing the temporal structure of a discourse which takes into account the effects of tense _comma_ aspect _comma_ temporal adverbials and rhetorical structure and which minimises unnecessary ambiguity in the temporal structure .
309,6,The input to our system is represented as a sequence of phonemes _comma_ so we implicitly assume that infants are able to convert from acoustic input to phoneme sequences ; research by Grieser and Kuhl 1989 suggests that this assumption is reasonable .

319,3,Heuristics similar to those described by Hardt 1992 may be used for this .
320,6,The formal system of constraints and rules for centering _comma_ as we have interpreted them from Grosz et al. 1986 _comma_ are as follows .
321,3,Our heuristic uses a set of features by which each of the parse candidates can be evaluated and compared .
322,3,takusan-no does not carry this nuance so ALT-J / E will translate a noun phrase modified by it as mass - uncountable _comma_ and takusan-no as many if the head is countable and much otherwise .
323,4,Such approaches are not new _comma_ witness the statistical approach to machine translation suggested by Weaver 1955 _comma_ but the current level of interest is largely due to the success of applying hidden Markov models and N-gram language models in speech recognition .
324,3,I write  for the set of standard objects _comma_ write for the total function from to _comma_ where [ for each and each _comma_ iff for some _comma_ _comma_ and write for the total function from to the set of partial functions from to _comma_ where [ for each _comma_ each and each _comma_ is defined _comma_ and iff _comma_ and for some _comma_ .

327,3,We consider each direction in turn .
328,2,Since the hallmark of the linear logic approach is to ensure that f-structure contributions are utilized exactly once in a derivation _comma_ such constructions would at first glance appear to be problematic for the approach .
329,4,In fact this fact is well known among Japanese linguists _comma_ i.e. Sells 1985 _comma_ Takubo 1987 .
330,3,Thus this work highlights aspects of collaboration in discourse _comma_ but should be formally integrated with research on collaborative planning Grosz and Sidner 1990 _comma_ Cohen et al. 1990 _comma_ particularly with respect to the relation between control shifts and the coordination of plans .
331,3,It is a complex state denoting John 's habit .

342,3,An intra-paragraph structure is a structure whose representation units are sentences _comma_ and an inter-paragraph structure is a structure whose representation units are paragraphs .
343,3,Iterated types are formed as follows :
344,3,While we partially attribute this difference to using a Bayes -ian instead of maximum-likelihood objective function _comma_ we believe that part of this difference results from a more effective search strategy .
345,3,Thus _comma_ the model admits both transcription schemes that result from the two views of downstep _comma_ and another besides _comma_ as shown later in  .
346,5,Go to step  .
347,5,The words in Fig.  marked with ( unit _comma_ book _comma_ and people ) are assumed to be origin words .
348,5,The reason that many models of belief transfer in dialogue would characterize them as redundant follows from a combination of facts :
349,3,Abdications _comma_ repetitions and summaries all add no new information and function to signal to the listener that the speaker has nothing further to say right now .
350,3,Thus _comma_ rules may mention more than one unbounded stack _comma_ but the stack associated with the mother is still associated with at most one daughter .

352,3,For `` seemed '' _comma_ left-context neighbors are words that have similar types of noun phrases in subject position ( mainly auxiliaries ) .
353,3,The temporal relations specified may be further refined as a by-product of establishing the coherence relationship extant between clauses _comma_ Narration being but one such relation .
354,3,This is consistent with experience Rayner et al. 1994 that _comma_ for the ATIS domain _comma_ trigrams model inter-word effects much better than bigrams do _comma_ but that extending the N-gram model beyond N = 3 is much less beneficial .
355,4,Most of natural languages provide two types of lexical items to describe the motion of an entity with respect to some location : motion verbs ( to run ; to enter ) and spatial prepositions ( from ; towards ) .

358,3,An optional item in a form is denoted by surrounding it with square brackets ` [ ... ] ' .
359,2,Although our overall presentation mechanism has much in common with that of RST-based text planners _comma_ the top-down planning operators contain mostly complex presentation schemata _comma_ like those in schema-based planning .
360,3,The two rules to express this are :
361,3,Now _comma_ since the counts of this sequent must be balanced _comma_ the sequence  must contain for each exactly 3 and exactly N as subformulae .
362,3,In Test  _comma_ if the predicate is marked in the dictionary as one that only applies to classes as a whole _comma_ such as evolve or be extinct _comma_ then the sentence is taken to be generic .
363,5,The situation  _comma_ used above in the mutual belief induction schema _comma_ is the context of what has been said .
364,3,For example _comma_ in  the order of the events is understood to be the reverse of that in due to the cue word because which signals a causal relationship between the events :

366,7,We present in this section the results of our research which has been implemented and in the next section _comma_ other directions which seems obviously promising .
367,3,According to the definition of unit element _comma_  .
368,2,The addition of extra operations also means that _comma_ for any given reading of a sentence there will generally be many different possible derivations ( so-called ` spurious ' ambiguity ) _comma_ making simple parsing strategies such as shift-reduce highly inefficient .
369,3,This corresponds exactly to the nodes in the and-or tree that exhibit high entropy values .
370,3,The clauses for  and are the usual definitions of classical logic _comma_ thus we have all propositional calculus at our disposal ; as we shall see _comma_ this gives us the flexibility required to formulate non-trivial general constraints .

396,3,The adjustment process in the third step of the algorithm does not attempt directly to decrease entropy but to achieve a clustering with the obviously desirable property that each training sentence is best predicted by the cluster it belongs to rather than by another cluster .
397,3,Normalize thickness  as _comma_ in each .
398,3,As explained there _comma_ our clustering procedure yields for each value of  a set of clusters minimizing the free energy F _comma_ and the asymmetric model for estimates the conditional verb distribution for a noun n by

402,4,Transcribed natural speech contains a number of frequent characteristic ` ungrammatical ' phenomena : filled pauses _comma_ repetitions _comma_ restarts _comma_ etc. ( as in e.g.
403,3,Also _comma_ we present the heuristics to reduce the number of edges so that we can upgrade the performance of our parser .
404,3,and combine it with  to derive :
405,3,In configurations like verb-object and adjective-noun _comma_ there is some evidence Pereira et al. 1993 that sharper word cooccurrence distributions are obtainable _comma_ leading to improved predictions by similarity techniques .

420,4,For instance _comma_ VP with suffix te is not regarded as a clause but a conjunct VP .
421,2,Past approaches to VP-ellipsis that operate within a single module of language processing fail to make the distinctions necessary to account for these differences .
422,5,Aslin et al. speculate that infants first learn words heard in isolation _comma_ then use distribution and prosody to refine and expand their vocabulary ; however _comma_ Jusczyk 1993 suggests that sound sequences learned in isolation differ too greatly from those in context to be useful .
423,3,The syntactic and semantic representations for the source clause of example  after fronting are shown in Figure ; the fronting leaves trace assumptions behind that are discharged when combined with their antecedents .

447,3,The accuracy of the tagging on unknown words dropped by about 5 % in general .
448,3,In addition _comma_ languages that provide an identifiable topic function ( e.g. Japanese ) suggest that topic takes precedence over subject .
449,3,It remains to be shown that an accurate broad-coverage parser can improve the performance of a text processing application .
450,5,The final CCG rule to be considered is the coordination rule that specifies that only like categories can coordinate :
451,3,The linear separability of data is related to its order _comma_ and this system uses higher order pairs and triples as input .
452,3,Function cv returns an associativity measure of two categories _comma_ which is calculated from the frequency of category collocation described in the previous section .
453,3,This work is being expanded to address issues pertaining to discourse structure and inter-segment coherence .
454,7,This is followed by discussion of the logic-based model in section  _comma_ the overall quantitative model in section _comma_ monolingual models in section _comma_ translation models in section _comma_ and some conclusions in section .
455,4,In the current computational and psycholinguistic literature there are two main approaches to the incremental construction of logical forms .
456,7,In the following paragraph we present an outline of the translation process .
457,3,As  decreases _comma_ remote words get a larger effect .
458,3,Valences for concatenation of each molecule are represented by typed lambda-variables .
459,3,It can be seen that first split separates the objects corresponding to the weaponry sense of `` fire '' ( cluster 1 ) from the ones corresponding to the personnel action ( cluster 2 ) .
460,3,However _comma_ if the clustering reflects significant dependencies _comma_ some of the worst inaccuracies of these assumptions may be reduced _comma_ and system performance may improve as a result .
461,5,The smoothing parameters  are trained through the Forward-Backward algorithm Baum and Eagon 1967 on held-out data .
462,3,The first stage in generating the countability and number of a translated English noun phrase is to determine its referentiality .
463,3,It is important to recall at this point that the interpretation language being used here is a highly intensional logic which permits quantification over arbitrary kinds of individual _comma_ including quantification over properties and propositions .
464,3,The results presented here suggest that cooperative strategies cannot be defined in the abstract _comma_ but cooperation arises from the interaction of two agents in dialogue .
465,3,In other words _comma_ this VP is an abstraction over events where somebody ate a peach .
466,3,It therefore becomes crucial to either perform some kind of ambiguity packing _comma_ or language tuning .
467,4,Furthermore _comma_ for incremental generation _comma_ the input information is produced and handed over step by step _comma_ so that it can be temporarily incomplete -- although as a whole it may become sufficient .
468,3,The first is that currently the rules for determining the noun phrase referentiality are insufficiently fine .
469,2,Intuitively _comma_ however _comma_ the need for the multiple use of an f-structure meaning results not from the appearance of a particular lexical item ( e.g. _comma_ a conjunction ) or a particular syntactic construction ( e.g. _comma_ parasitic gap constructions ) _comma_ but instead results from multiple paths to it from within the f-structure that contains it _comma_ where structure sharing is motivated on syntactic grounds .
470,4,Since the late ' 80 s part-of-speech ( POS ) disambiguation using Hidden Markov Models ( HMM ) has been a widespread method for tagging texts .
471,3,In case of such a conflict _comma_ the node ( class ) with the lowest entropy is removed from the set of cutnodes .
472,3,The symbol `  ' before the name of a rule marks it as being an ` ignore ' rule .
473,7,In this section I present the problem of relating sequences of F  values to tone transcriptions .
474,1,In this paper we present a technique for fully unsupervised statistical acquisition of rules which guess possible parts-of-speech for unknown words .
475,3,After removing unreachable rules _comma_ this yields a grammar of roughly 30 nonterminals _comma_ 120 terminals _comma_ and 160 rules .
476,4,For agglutinative languages such as Korean _comma_ Finnish and Turkish Kwon and Karttunen 1994 _comma_ Koskenniemi 1983 _comma_ Oflazer 1993 _comma_ dimension is very large _comma_ so creating an exhaustive word list is out of the question unless the lexicon is trivial .
477,3,There were arbitrary limits of a maximum of 10 words in the pre-subject and 10 words within the subject for the initial work described here .
478,3,Dynamic grammars can be regarded purely as formal systems _comma_ as direct representations of processing _comma_ or as something inbetween ( for example _comma_ in the packed parallel parser described in Milward 1994a _comma_ the actual parsing states are packed versions of the states in the grammar ) .
479,3,Although the fourth and fifth sentences are clearly the exemplification of the first three sentences _comma_ the sixth is not .
480,5,The properties of the system ensure that meanings are used exactly once _comma_ allowing coherence and completeness conditions on f-structures Kaplan and Bresnan 1982 _comma_ to be maintained .
481,3,Our needs are fairly simple _comma_ and do not require an extensive survey of the complexities that arise in that literature .
482,5,A similar approach was taken in Weischedel et al. 1993 where an unknown word was guessed given the probabilities for an unknown word to be of a particular POS _comma_ its capitalisation feature and its ending .
483,3,They can also be referred to as a class in a rule body by the special RHS clause `  ' .
484,4,A rather more difficult problem is that of providing types for all possible conjuncts .
485,3,Thus assuming that q was inferred relies on the assumption that B believes that p licenses q in the context .
486,3,In this case it leads either to an intermediate filtering step for the non-chaining sentence rule or to the addition of the literal corresponding to the subject np to all chain and non-chain rules along the path to the semantic head .
487,3,Gafos and Brent 1994 demonstrate that phonotactics can be learned with high accuracy from the same unsegmented utterances we used in our simulations .
488,3,It then outlines the neural net selection process .
489,4,and where we denote the training data as O _comma_ for observations .
490,3,Furthermore _comma_ the object checks whether the previously uttered part of the sentence includes some of the revised material ( i.e. _comma_ whether the object itself has participated in uttering ) .
491,3,for each  and each _comma_ if then _comma_ is defined _comma_ and
492,3,remain as mentioned in section  .
493,3,If no such training corpus is available _comma_ but a lexicon with at least relative frequency data is available _comma_ use BW re-estimation for a small number of iterations .
494,7,We discuss the matter in the paper 's concluding section .
495,5,It is mutually believed in a population P that  if and only if some situation holds such that :
496,2,As we saw earlier : even for CFG it holds that there can be an infinite number of analyses for a given FSA ( but in the CFG this of course does not imply undecidability ) .
497,3,We postulate rules characterizing the referential nature of tense and the role of discourse relations in further constraining the temporal relations between clauses .
498,7,The content of this paper can be summarized as follows .
499,5,For example _comma_ if the two types _comma_ n / n and n / n are composed to give the type n / n _comma_ then this can be modified by an adjectival modifier of type ( n / n ) / ( n / n ) .
500,5,To represent a function which requires an np on the left _comma_ and an np and a pp to the right _comma_ there is a choice of the following three types using Curried notation :
501,3,Punctuation marks _comma_ special symbols _comma_ interjections _comma_ foreign words and tags with fewer than 100 instances were excluded from the evaluation .
502,3,As previously said _comma_ the purpose of ignore rules is simply to consume input terminals _comma_ and their intended use is in facilitating repairs in analysing input that contains the false starts _comma_ restarts _comma_ filled pauses _comma_ etc .
503,3,A model was trained from a hand-tagged corpus in the manner described above _comma_ and then degraded in various ways to simulate the effect of poorer training _comma_ as follows :
504,3,Proposition 23 .
505,3,Thus _comma_ the rhetorical structure for this text can be represented by a binary-tree as shown in Fig.  .
506,3,Also _comma_ whereas Park 1992 requires careful consideration of handling of determiners with coordination _comma_ here such sentences are handled just like any others .
507,3,For each  _comma_ for each subrfrant of _comma_ for each link in :
508,3,The assymetry in using the event time for e and the location time for e ' arises from the interpretation rules of temporal connectives ( for both quantified and non-quantified sentences ) .
509,1,We presented a brief description of an algorithm for determining the temporal structure of discourse .
510,3,This research program will provide complementary evidence supporting hypotheses about the sources of information infants use in learning their native languages .
511,3,In order to evaluate the performance of the learning process we inspected manually the SRs acquired on the testing-sample _comma_ assessing if they corresponded to the actual SRs imposed .
512,3,When using the full heuristics _comma_ the percentage of sentences _comma_ for which the parser returned a parse that matched or almost matched the `` correct '' parse increased from 50 % to 75 % .
513,5,Other types of conditional cooccurrence probabilities have been used in probabilistic parsing Black et al. 1993 .
514,3,Pronominal event reference _comma_ on the other hand _comma_ appears not to display this dependence .
515,1,In this work neural networks are used as part of a fully automated system that finds a partial parse of declarative sentences .
516,3,Our experimental results indicate that such a thesaurus can be used to improve accuracy in disambiguation .
517,4,In recent years there has been a resurgence of interest in statistical approaches to natural language processing .
518,4,Moreover _comma_ the resulting f-structure respects the LFG well formedness conditions _comma_ namely the uniqueness _comma_ completeness and coherence principles discussed in section  .
519,4,Although both frameworks are equivalent in weak generative capacity -- both derive exactly the context-free languages -- _comma_ LCG is superior to CG in that it can cope in a natural way with extraction and unbounded dependency phenomena .
520,3,This covers only a subset of the above types .
521,3,Thus _comma_ to obtain the LF for John and Bill _comma_ the following query would be made :
522,5,Such an extreme case would be a recursive rule for semantically empty particles :
523,3,Furthermore we discuss approaches to cope with the problem .
524,4,Stated prove-theoretically for Gentzen-style systems _comma_ this amounts to disallowing the left rule for  .
525,3,app encodes application _comma_ and so in the derivation of harry found _comma_ the type-raised harry has the  -Prolog value .
526,3,The abundance of interpretations seems to preclude an effective algorithm to decide if a feature structure is satisfiable .
527,5,The hearer will then reconstruct a model of the speaker 's intentions upon hearing the utterance .
528,3,If there is to be no modification of the verb phrase _comma_ no verb phrase structure is introduced .
529,3,The procedures consist of the following four steps :
530,4,This might block the formation of an intention to inform _comma_ but what is it that inspires the agent to respond at all .
531,3,adjective vs. noun ( public _comma_ million _comma_ high ) _comma_
532,3,a lexicon listing word forms with their equivalence classes _comma_ that is the list of POS tags that can be assigned to the word form _comma_
533,4,Replacements correct pieces of information e.g.
534,3,The  -Prolog code fragment shown in Figure declares how the CCG logical forms are represented .
535,7,Since _comma_ as we will see _comma_ clustering does yield benefits in this domain _comma_ it seems very plausible that it will also do so for other _comma_ more naturally clustered domains .
536,3,The mental actions in the plan will encode only useful descriptions .
537,3,The two texts used for training the HMM were selected from the German data contained on the ECI 's Multilingual CD-ROM ECI 1994 : a 200_comma_000 and 2_comma_000_comma_000 word sample from Summer 1992 issues of the German newspaper Frankfurter Rundschau .
538,3,Thus after likes is absorbed the state category will need to expect an np .
539,4,In this context _comma_ a model with less clusters _comma_ such as Model 2 in Figure  _comma_ tends to be simpler ( in terms of the number of parameters ) _comma_ but also tends to have a poorer fit to the data .
540,3,Because feature structures associated with all nodes in the tree are available _comma_ feature information need only be passed up the tree when it is required in order to establish dependencies within the derivation tree .
541,3,If an utterance has not been understood _comma_ or is believed to be deficient in some way _comma_ this brings about an obligation to repair the utterance .
542,5,In Zhang and Kim 1990 a system for the automated learning of morphological word-formation rules is described .
543,3,Although models pin down the essence of the LFG universe _comma_ our work has only just begun .
544,3,The addition of non-unit clauses should be made dependent on the goal and the base cases in order to go from a purely bottom-up algorithm to a directed algorithm that combines the advantages of top-down and bottom-up processing .
545,3,Joe 's next utterance _comma_ but I am for 82 _comma_ reinforces the implicature that Harry makes in  _comma_ and upgrades the evidence underlying the assumption that licenses to linguistic .
546,3,That is _comma_ partial linearity permits feature values to be shared between daughters where they are not also shared with the mother .
547,3,The reasons for this are unclear _comma_ and the results are not always the same with other corpora _comma_ which suggests that they are not statistically significant .
548,1,A German language model for the Xerox HMM tagger is presented .
549,3,Of Dutch ?
550,5,Such functions have been used in tandem with statistical functions in experiments on disambiguation Alshawi and Carter 1994 .
551,3,Those parts of the input that have been ` ignored ' are considered to have been consumed .
552,3,This should be reflected in different distribution of anaphora in the two cases .
553,5,For instance _comma_ there is a substantial body of papers on the extraction of `` frequently co-occurring words '' from corpora using statistical methods Choueka et al. 1983 _comma_ Church and Hanks 1989 _comma_ Smadja 1993 to list only a few .
554,3,As for the editorial articles _comma_ The average correspondence rates of the key sentence and the most important key sentence among the subjects were 60 % and 60 % respectively .
555,3,We use the estimates given by the standard back-off model _comma_ which satisfy that requirement .
556,3,Here _comma_ it would appear _comma_ only one reading is possible _comma_ i.e. the one where John gave Mary her slice of pizza just after she stared or started to stare at him .
557,3,P is the path interpretation function under I iff [ I is an interpretation  _comma_
558,3,The planning task then is to satisfy the obligation of responding to the question _comma_ without revealing the answer if at all possible .
559,5,Most CGs either choose the third of these ( to give a vp structure ) _comma_ or include a rule of Associativity which means that the types are interchangeable ( in the Lambek Calculus _comma_ Associativity is a consequence of the calculus _comma_ rather than being specified separately ) .
560,4,Typically _comma_ training makes use of a manually tagged corpus _comma_ or an untagged corpus with some initial bootstrapping probabilities .
561,3,The application of the control rules to these dialogues lets us derive domain-independent discourse segments with each segment being controlled by one or other discourse participant .
562,3,the search region for the second s clause is P-C ( i.e. from the end of the conjunction island to the end of the LHS search region ) _comma_ its island ends at E and covers U items ;
563,3,Firstly we show garu 's syntax .
564,4,However _comma_ consider  _comma_ said in discussing which Indian restaurant to go to for lunch :
565,5,Wagner administered a questionnaire to native speakers of Irish Gaelic in 86 sites .
566,4,If all of the syntactic variations which are realised in the inflectional system were represented in the tagset _comma_ there would be a huge number of tags _comma_ and it would be practically impossible to implement or train a simple tagger .
567,3,This first response seems to be a very promising line of work : the requisite tools are there _comma_ and the approach would tackle a full blooded version of LFG head on .
568,3,The neural net is trained in supervised mode on examples that have been manually marked `` correct '' and `` incorrect '' .
569,3,Also _comma_ some simplification of the current model parameters may be possible _comma_ especially with respect to the parameters t and k used to select the nearest neighbors of a word .
570,2,A second problem is that many isoglosses do not neatly bisect the language area .
571,3,for each  _comma_ [ is the functional composition of
572,3,count occurrence frequencies of category collocations ( section  )
573,5,A sketch of the organisation of GB ( the ` T-model ' ) is shown in figure  .
574,5,First _comma_ an agent must communicate that she has not understood a plan .
575,3,Each node  of the semantic network Paradigme computes its activity value at time as follows :
576,3,The relation top/1 defines the start symbol .
577,4,Given this variation _comma_ in a text retrieval context the problems are
578,3,This work is supported by ARO grant DAAL03 - 89 - 0031 _comma_ DARPA grant N00014 - 90-J - 1863 _comma_ and ARO grant DAAH04 - 94-G - 0426 .
579,7,looking at the performance of the techniques used for extracting triples _comma_
580,2,In addition _comma_ it cures a slight overgeneration problem in Dalrymple et al. 's account .
581,3,Thus _comma_ judging the adequacy of a referring expression plan falls out of the regular plan evaluation process .
582,3,In the experiments _comma_ the CE technique results in a parser with worse performance than the normal LR technique .
583,3,We could show that natural language syntax is self-organizable _comma_ in that each linguistic objects do not need to be poured into ` molds ' _comma_ viz. _comma_ externally given grammar .
584,3,Depending on whether the hearer of the expression makes a suggestion or not _comma_ the initiator has two options when elaborating a plan .
585,5,As a result of characterizing filtering by a definite clause representation Magic brings filtering inside of the logic underlying the grammar .
586,5,According to van Noord _comma_ two syntax-semantics pairs are linkable if their semantic forms are identical _comma_ i.e.
587,5,The best of these methods are reported to achieve 82 - 85 % of tagging accuracy on unknown words Brill 1995 _comma_ Weischedel et al. 1993 .
588,4,For instance _comma_ the meaning constructor for the verb supported is a glue language formula paraphrasable as : `` If my SUBJ means X and (  ) my OBJ means Y _comma_ then ( ) my sentence means '' .
589,2,However _comma_ as the semantic terms become more complex _comma_ it is no trivial matter to write  - reduction that will correctly handle variable capture .
590,3,A note worth adding : it is not clear that the `` exact match '' criterion -- that is _comma_ evaluating algorithms by the percentage of exact matches of sense selection against a human-judged baseline -- is the right task .
591,3,It is clear from the tables that incorporating context improves performance considerably .
592,2,For instance _comma_ it was not clear in the previous account how non-parallel constructions embedded within parallel constructions would be handled _comma_ as in sentences  :
593,3,The predicate always succeeds _comma_ and as a side-effect asserts that its argument is a rule of the parse forest grammar .
594,3,The LR parsing tables constitute a type of top-down filtering _comma_ but this may not be sufficient to guarantee termination _comma_ and in any case _comma_ a lot of spurious applications of empty productions will most likely take place _comma_ degrading performance .
595,4,Expressions of the meaning language ( such as Bill ) appear on the right side of the meaning relation  .
596,3,Consider again the F  contour in Figure .
597,3,The information of structures is also expected to improve segmentation accuracy .
598,1,The aim of our work is to explore the feasibility of using an statistical method for extracting SRs from on-line corpora .
599,3,Move 1 : Create a rule of the form
600,7,We address this issue in more detail in section  .
601,1,The substitutional treatment of ellipsis presented here has broadly the same coverage as Dalrymple et al. 's higher-order unification treatment _comma_ but has the computational advantages of
602,2,The basic shortcoming of the maximum-likelihood objective function is that it does not encompass the compelling intuition behind Occam 's Razor _comma_ that simpler ( or smaller ) grammars are preferable over complex ( or larger ) grammars .
603,2,I claim that these assumptions must be dropped in order to explain the function of IRU 's in dialogue .
604,3,Hyphens used to emphasise a word _comma_ e.g. har-mo-ni-ser _comma_ also leave endings unaltered .
605,3,In the latter case _comma_ two situations may arise : either the prefix is shared between nouns and some other category ( such as ment ) _comma_ or it must be barred from the list of noun endings ( such as aient _comma_ an inflectional marking of third person plural verbs ) .
606,4,Lexical cohesion is the relationship between words _comma_ classified as follows :
607,1,We induce models that _comma_ while being substantially more compact _comma_ outperform n-gram language models in medium-sized domains .
608,2,Sidner 1992 _comma_ Sidner 1994 formulated an artificial language for modeling collaborative discourse using proposal / acceptance and proposal / rejection sequences ; however _comma_ her work is descriptive and does not specify response generation strategies for agents involved in collaborative interactions .
609,3,Ultimately _comma_ some of the techniques developed here should be able to be extended to more complex formalisms such as HPSG .
610,3,If an obligation is not satisfied _comma_ then this means that one of the rules must have been broken .
611,3,In Milward 1992 _comma_ the dynamics specifies a word-by-word incremental parser for a lexicalised version of dependency grammar .
612,3,This can be done by simply repeating the reduction process until one gets the desired length of abstract .
613,3,two constants _comma_ c-struct and f-struct _comma_
614,3,Production rule tree 17 is that for a single application of the rule adjp _ adjp _ fem _comma_ which describes the feminine form of the an adjective _comma_ where the root is taken to be the masculine form .
615,5,On the other hand _comma_ the different characteristics of within-language and between-language associations account for the independent functional behavior .
616,3,I used the first 51 concepts _comma_ or about 4500 different string tokens _comma_ as part of an ongoing project to enter all of the atlas into machine readable format .
617,5,In first-order unification _comma_ it is simulated as shown in Figure  .
618,3,Results are presented here individually by judge .
619,3,The programs make crucial use of the prediction function  in evaluating candidate tone transcriptions .
620,3,Some of these forms will appear in our examples .
621,3,This principle predicates that a writer usually presents shorter branches before longer ones .
622,3,very few rules license both left and right recursion ( for instance of the sort that is typically used to analyse noun compounding _comma_ i.e.  ) .
623,5,This requires a reasonable definition of verb similarity and a similarity estimation method .
624,1,We tackle this issue here _comma_ proposing an algorithm to co-ordinate the treatment of these two problems efficiently _comma_ i.e. _comma_ the aim is also to exploit at each step all the results that each component can provide .
625,3,I therefore conclude that the presence of more than one table for R indicates an interplay between R values and the ratio h / l .
626,3,u is a standard object iff [ u is a quadruple  _comma_
627,4,The objective function is taken to be some measure dependent on the training data ; one generally wants to find a grammar that in some sense accurately models the training data .
628,1,The text planner discussed in this paper is the macroplanner of PROVERB _comma_ which translates machine-found proofs in several steps into natural language .
629,5,This ordering must respect the linguistic constraints which have been transferred into the target signs .
630,3,Apparent counterexamples are as follows :
631,2,The common stipulation within the literature stating that gapping applies to coordinate structures and not to subordinate ones does not account for why any coordinated cases are unacceptable .
632,4,Does the language of Connacht naturally group with that of Ulster or with that of Munster ?
633,3,The probability distributions are far too `` gappy '' and even if a huge amount of data were collected _comma_ the chances that they would provide the desired path for a sentence of any reasonable length are slim .
634,3,This schema means that when A says u to B intending to convey p _comma_ that this leads to the mutual belief that B understands u as p under certain assumptions .
635,3,In each case _comma_ the IRU addresses one or more assumptions that have to be made in order to infer that mutual understanding has actually been achieved .
636,3,Definition 4 .
637,3,For each algorithm _comma_ we list the best performance achieved over all n tried _comma_ and the best n column states which value realized this performance .
638,6,Related work on French can be found in Derouault 1985 .
639,5,Pulman 1994 's equational treatment of context-dependency suggests one method of dealing with such cases .
640,3,precision - the percentage of POS s the guesser assigned correctly over the total number of POS s it assigned to the word ; .
641,3,To do this _comma_ all that is needed is an extra feature focus in the descriptions of linguistic items .
642,4,At one time the Gaelic language group was spoken throughout Ireland _comma_ from where it spread to the Isle of Man and to much of Scotland .
643,5,It has been repeatedly noted Kay 1980 _comma_ Wiren 1987 _comma_ Bouma and van Noord 1993 that directed methods are more efficient than pure top-down or bottom-up methods .
644,5,For example _comma_ Beaven 1992a employs a chart to avoid recalculating the same combinations of signs more than once during testing _comma_ and Popowich 1994 proposes a more general technique for storing which rule applications have been attempted ; Brew 1992 avoids certain pathological cases by employing global constraints on the solution space ; researchers such as Brown et al. 1990 and Chen and Lee 1994 provide a system for bag generation that is heuristically guided by probabilities .
645,5,I have argued elsewhere that such a language is required for a wide variety of phenomena .
646,6,The key to this algorithm is the use of structure sharing techniques similar to those used to process LIG efficiently Vijay-Shanker and Weir 1993 .
647,7,We give the main steps of the algorithm that is defined on the backbone of stratified logic .
648,2,These theories all depend on extra-linguistic knowledge _comma_ the accumulation of which presents a problem in the realization of a practical analyzer .
649,4,Collocations present specific problems in translation _comma_ both in human and automatic contexts .
650,3,topic ; and
651,7,The following section examines related work in order to clarify the nature of the semantic similarity .
652,4,SRs may have different applications in NLP _comma_ specifically _comma_ they may help a parser with Word Sense Selection ( WSS ) Hirst 1987 _comma_ with preferring certain structures out of several grammatical ones Whittemore et al. 1990 and finally with deciding the semantic role played by a syntactic complement Basili et al. 1992 .
653,3,We conducted some experiments to automatically acquire case frame patterns from the Penn Tree Bank bracketed corpus .
654,7,In subsequent sections _comma_ we show how the distinct mechanisms for recovering these types of missing information interact with two types of discourse inference to predict the phenomena noted in the previous section .
655,4,For example _comma_ Syriac  mdnt ` city ' is pronounced /mdt/ .
656,3,The result of this is that the retraction of that belief results in many beliefs being revised .
657,3,The main result of this exploratory study is the finding that control is a useful parameter for identifying discourse structure .
658,3,Now _comma_ although he cannot refashion the expression himself _comma_ he does have the ability to help the initiator by suggesting a good way to expand it ; suggestion is a conversational move in which an agent suggests a new attribute that he deems would increase his confidence in the expression 's adequacy if the expression were expanded to include the attribute .
659,5,To date _comma_ psychologists have focused on two aspects of the speech segmentation problem .
660,3,more than 90 % of the rules in the grammar have no more than two daughters _comma_ and
661,2,In addition _comma_ question answering systems often fail to take account of the system 's role as a conversational partner .
662,3,As evidence for these claims _comma_ I present results showing that clustering improves some models but not others for the ATIS domain .
663,3,For each node  in Paradigme _comma_ let its rfr be an empty set .
664,3,Despite this _comma_ in the practical experiments reported in the previous section the parsers achieve relatively good throughput with a general-purpose wide-coverage grammar of a natural language .
665,3,If the final constraint does not hold _comma_ then the invalidity is noted so that the plan can be operated on appropriately by the discourse plans .
666,3,Or : [TABLE]
667,3,Rising accuracy for a small number of iterations ( 2 - 4 ) _comma_ and then falling as in initial maximum .
668,3,I then use this interpretation to define the notion of a satisfiable feature structure .
669,3,( See also Figure  and . )
670,1,In this paper _comma_ I tailor the semantics of King 1989 to suit the typed feature structures of Carpenter 1992 _comma_ and so create an explicit interpretation of a typed feature structure used as a description .
671,3,In the ADs both participants believe that a plan cannot be constructed without contributions from both of them .
672,3,A model based on obligations differs from an intention-based approach in that obligations are independent of shared plans and intention recognition .
673,3,The first role can be captured using syntactic types _comma_ where each type corresponds to a potentially infinite number of partial syntax trees .
674,3,We focus on the spatial and the temporal intrinsic semantic properties of the motion verbs _comma_ on the one hand _comma_ and of the spatial prepositions _comma_ on the other hand .
675,4,Conversation between two people has a number of characteristics that have yet to be modeled adequately in human-computer dialogue .
676,3,The lexicon is realized as a finite state transducer for the DDS Tagger .
677,3,We won't show the complete declaration of the  - reducer _comma_ but the key clause is simply :
678,2,Many of the kinds of language model used in speech understanding suffer from imperfect modeling of intra-sentential contextual influences .
679,4,This is where word-POS guessers take their place -- they employ the analysis of word features _comma_ e.g. word leading and trailing characters _comma_ to figure out its possible POS categories .
680,3,These observations are clearer in Figure  _comma_ which ( roughly speaking ) displays the peaks and valleys from Figure .
681,2,This approach bears comparison with probabilistic systems _comma_ but has the advantage that negative as well as positive information can be modelled .
682,3,However _comma_ we will see that these spurious derivations do not translate into spurious ambiguity in the parser _comma_ which maps from strings of words directly to semantic representations .
683,3,In our model _comma_ discourse structure is defined as the rhetorical structure _comma_ i.e. _comma_ the compound of rhetorical relations between sentences in text .
684,3,Secondly _comma_ all transitions between states occur on the input of a new word : there are no ` empty ' transitions ( such as the reduce step of a shift-reduce parser ) .
685,3,But which formal specification language ?
686,3,The technique shows practical promise .
687,3,For data we used the Brown corpus of English text samples of uniform length _comma_ categorized in several categories as seen in table  .
688,3,is a partial function from the Cartesian product of and to _comma_ and
689,4,Part-of-speech tagging is of interest for a number of applications _comma_ for example access to text data bases Kupiec 1993 _comma_ robust parsing Abney 1991 _comma_ and general parsing de Marcken 1990 _comma_ Charniak et al. 1994 .
690,3,We then view the problem of clustering words as that of estimating a probabilistic model ( representing probability distribution ) that generates such data .
691,5,Work similar to that described here has been carried out by Merialdo 1994 _comma_ with broadly similar conclusions .
692,3,Finally _comma_ the method fails if there are no local dependencies that could be used for categorization and only non-local dependencies are informative .
693,6,The approach to representing semantic relationships we take is one used by Morris and Hirst wherein the words in the lexicon are associated with each other in a thesaurus-like fashion and given a rating according to how semantically `` close '' they are .
694,3,Other tasks _comma_ such as a management / union negotiation _comma_ only require the agents to agree on the actions to be carried out and each agent can have its own reasons for wanting those actions to be done without affecting success in the task .
695,3,In doing so _comma_ we readily deal with phenomena like scope parallelism .
696,6,The data for my study were taken from Wagner 1958 .
697,3,Tense in VP-ellipsis illustrates how categories can be put to work
698,4,Luckily ` ordinary ' recognizers / parsers for CFG can be easily generalized to construct this intersection yielding ( in typical cases ) a much smaller grammar .
699,5,The third allows there to be a verb phrase modifier .
700,4,Words unknown to the lexicon present a substantial problem to part-of-speech ( POS ) tagging of real-world texts .
701,3,A more detailed analysis would require an empirical comparison of the two methods on the same corpus and task .
702,3,TENSE : past _comma_ pres _comma_ fut
703,2,This paper begins from a rather different starting point .
704,3,The complexity of the rewrite phase is that of locating the two TNCBs to be combined .
705,4,Alternatively _comma_ a procedure called Baum-Welch ( BW ) re-estimation may be used _comma_ in which an untagged corpus is passed through the FB algorithm with some initial model _comma_ and the resulting probabilities used to determine new values for the lexical and transition probabilities .
706,3,The grammar is loosely based on three modules taken from Government-Binding Theory -- X-bar theory _comma_ Theta Theory and Case Theory .
707,5,Figure  shows five examples of implicit parse trees .
708,3,There is a unique association of input increments and objects of VM-GEN ( OBJ is used as identifier ) that allows for translating an input modification into a modification of the state of the respective object .
709,3,Given a derived fact or seed magic_cat_1 ( property_1 ) bottom-up evaluation of the abstract grammar in ifigure  leads to spurious ambiguity .
710,5,This is the basis of our hypothesis that the distances in the reference network reflect the associative distances between words Nitta 1993 .
711,3,R to
712,3,Shallow processing is also interesting because it should be cheaper and faster than a complete analysis of the whole sentence .
713,5,positions which are parts of a location ( the position where I am in this room ) ;
714,3,The final section contrasted parsing with lexicalised and rule based grammars _comma_ and argued that statistical language tuning is particularly suitable for incremental _comma_ lexicalised parsing strategies .
715,3,We did not use a test set disjoint from the training set _comma_ and we do not claim that the functions we had the method extract from the data are useful in themselves .
716,3,This makes it possible for the semantic formulas to exploit information about the multiple paths into an f-structure in order to account for the multiple uses of the f-structure 's semantic contribution .
717,5,Since a warrant makes the dialogue longer _comma_ the Explicit-Warrant strategy might be inefficient whenever either of these situations hold .
718,3,We also conclude that  _comma_ ( l / h = 1.1 ) and .
719,3,is an effective algorithm _comma_ and for each feature structure F _comma_ a list of the resolvants of F .
720,3,where  .
721,3,It is also possible to set local thresholds dynamically _comma_ by making use of the ` { prolog code } ' facility :
722,3,This is because without top-down filtering _comma_ any empty production is applicable at any point in the input string _comma_ and a naive bottom-up parser will loop indefinitely .
723,3,The processing described in this paper has been implemented in NTT Communication Science Laboratories ' experimental machine translation system ALT-J / E Ikehara et al. 1991 .
724,4,Agents make strategy choices via decisions about when to talk _comma_ when to let the other agent talk _comma_ what to say _comma_ and how to say it .
725,3,For a corpus in which a fraction a of the words are ambiguous _comma_ and p is the accuracy on ambiguous words _comma_ the overall accuracy can be recovered from 1-a + pa .
726,5,The actual definition for link length will be given later .
727,5,While this is a domain where the assumption of co-operation is generally valid _comma_ the obligation model still provides for a much simpler analysis of the discourse behavior than a strongly plan-based account .
728,5,This system divides a string into three regions and from training examples infers their correspondence to underlying morphological features .
729,3,In the case of formulas _comma_ they may be given both the values true and false _comma_ corresponding to the formula being true under one possible resolution and false under another .
730,3,These are now extended to 15 words in the pre-subject _comma_ 12 in the subject - see Section  .
731,3,Both trees have the same syntactic type _comma_ however in the first case we want to allow for there to be an s  s modifier of the lower s _comma_ but not in the second .
732,3,Preference values can ( but need not ) be interpreted as probabilities .
733,5,This is very similar to the way in which wh-movement is dealt with in GPSG Gazdar et al. 1985 and HPSG _comma_ where wh-arguments are treated using slash mechanisms or feature inheritance principles which correspond closely to function composition .
734,5,The Troll unifier is closed on these representations .
735,3,In our experiments we measured word precision and word recall ( micro-average ) .
736,3,In this way _comma_ the estimated function would be a probability distribution _comma_ and more interesting _comma_ nouns would provide evidence on the occurrence of their hyperonyms _comma_ inversely proportional to their degree of ambiguity .
737,2,Therefore _comma_ in our similarity model w ' will play a stronger role in estimating w than vice versa .
738,4,For example _comma_ consider ` antecedents ' for the following :
739,3,Furthermore _comma_ re-entrancy in the form of shared feature structures within and across nodes will be found in PLPATR ( see for example Figure  ) .
740,3,Whether the constraints will ultimately require monolingual grammars to be enriched with entirely unmotivated features will only become clear as translation coverage is extended and new language pairs are added .
741,3,In practical terms _comma_ a naive interactive parallel Prolog implementation on a current workstation fails to be interactive in a real sense after about 8 words .
742,3,They were separated on distributional criteria that don't have linguistic correlates .
743,3,A possible explanation is that in this case the test data does not overlap with the training data _comma_ and hence the good quality lexicons ( D0 and D1 ) have less of an influence .
744,3,For Judge 1 _comma_ there were 99 test instances with sufficiently high confidence to be considered .
745,4,There are different types of text .
746,3,an external zone of contact required by verbs like atterir for which the final location is neither the lref ( in contrast with entrer ) or the outside ( or proximity outside ) of the lref ( in contrast with s 'approcher - to approach ) .
747,5,The interconnections among the three systems explain the interdependent functional behavior .
748,3,A preference rule used in this process represents a heuristic local preference on consecutive rhetorical relations between sentences .
749,3,This well-known NP-complete problem is cited in Garey and Johnson 1979 as follows .
750,4,For instance _comma_ one of the senses of the verb drink restricts its subject to be an animal and its object to be a liquid .
751,1,In this paper I report on an investigation into the problem of assigning tones to pitch contours .
752,3,For example _comma_ the following sentence  denotes the state _comma_ s _comma_ holding at the present _comma_ that Mary has met the president .
753,3,Also _comma_ this is by no means a closed research issue _comma_ but merely a first attempt to realize the scheme _comma_ and there is no doubt in my mind that it can be improved on most substantially .
754,3,If the sentence finishes just after `` garu / gat-ta '' _comma_ the important points are
755,3,Testing the developed techniques uncovered important constraints on the form of the phrase structure rules in a grammar imposed by the compiler .
756,2,However _comma_ although the practical throughput of parsers with such realistic grammars is important _comma_ for example when processing large amounts of text or in interactive applications _comma_ there is little published research that compares the performance of different parsing algorithms using wide-coverage unification-based grammars .
757,3,The semantic network Paradigme is systematically constructed from the small and closed English dictionary Glossme .
758,5,Probably the best known algorithm for tracking narrative progression is that developed by Kamp 1979 _comma_ Hinrichs 1981 _comma_ and Partee 1984 _comma_ which formalises the observation that an event will occur just after a preceding event _comma_ while a state will overlap with a preceding event .
759,2,However _comma_ it makes sense to choose as a similarity measure the quantity we would like the final clustering arrangement to minimize : the expected entropy ( or _comma_ equivalently _comma_ perplexity ) of sentences from the domain .
760,3,However _comma_ only the initiator of the referring expression can actually elaborate a referring expression _comma_ because only she has the knowledge to do so .
761,3,If not _comma_ the DCU may continue any of the highest rated threads _comma_ and each of these solutions is generated .
762,3,Because  _comma_ 1 is a solution of the equation .
763,3,Thus examples such as  are dealt with _comma_ since the syntactic context after You can call me does not distinguish between one or more than one subsequent modifier .
764,1,In this paper _comma_ I report two experiments designed to determine how much manual training information is needed .
765,3,Yet intuitively _comma_ they are similar with respect to their right syntactic context despite the lack of common right neighbors .
766,3,These are needed to distinguish between cases of real functional arguments ( of functions of functions ) _comma_ and functions formed by State-Prediction .
767,4,Grammar induction can be framed as a search problem _comma_ and has been framed as such almost without exception in past research Angluin and Smith 1983 .
768,5,The cooccurrence smoothing technique Essen and Steinbiss 1992 _comma_ based on earlier stochastic speech modeling work by Sugawara et al. 1985 _comma_ is the main previous attempt to use similarity to estimate the probability of unseen events in language modeling .
769,3,Again _comma_ the disambiguation algorithm performs well _comma_ with 60.5 % correct .
770,3,With these assumptions _comma_ a preference value of a structure is calculated by recursive function p as follows :
771,3,Macroplanning produces a sequence of PCAs .
772,3,In our method the required parse is found by inferring the grammar from both positive and negative information _comma_ which is effectively modelled by the neural net .
773,3,Consider the following pairing of sentence fragments with their simplest possible CG type :
774,3,In comparison with the ending-guessing rules _comma_ the morphological rules have much better precision and hence better accuracy of guessing .
775,6,In order to capture the agents ' intentions conveyed by their utterances _comma_ our model of collaborative negotiation utilizes an enhanced version of the dialogue model described in Lambert and Carberry 1991 to represent the current status of the interaction .
776,1,We have developed an automatic abstract generation system for Japanese expository writings based on rhetorical structure extraction .
777,3,A missing number indicates that there was only one choice in the lexicon .
778,1,This paper has discussed an instance of a general problem in the design of conversational agents : when to include optional information .
779,1,In order to explore the relationship of control and initiative to discourse processes like centering _comma_ we analyze the distribution of four different classes of anaphora for two data sets .
780,3,Although important _comma_ we will say little about search algorithms _comma_ rule acquisition _comma_ or parameter estimation .
781,4,is _comma_ in GB term _comma_ [-anaphoric_comma_+pronominal ] or pro .
782,3,To correct _comma_ the morphological analyser is executed in generation mode to generate the broken plural form of { kd } in the normal way .
783,7,whether the expression leaves behind an empty constituent in the syntax _comma_ and
784,3,The algorithm runs essentially in time and space linear in the size of the training data _comma_ so larger domains are within our reach .
785,3,is finite _comma_
786,3,This technique is also used in the  - reducer briefly mentioned at the end of the previous section _comma_ and a similar technique will be used here to implement coordination by recursively descending through the two arguments to be coordinated .
787,3,INFORMATION QUALITY :
788,3,For example _comma_ for the text in Fig.  _comma_ the structure candidates which contain the substructure _comma_ which says sentence six is the entailment of sentence four and five only _comma_ are penalized .
789,4,Consider the grammar given in Figure  .
790,3,For the most part the import of these clauses should be clear .
791,3,It is with respect to this subset of the data that the alternate hypotheses are examined .
792,4,This node is called the terminator of the node labelled  .
793,4,A discourse strategy is a strategy for communicating with another agent .
794,5,Other corpora _comma_ such as Wall Street Journal articles _comma_ might also be expected to fall naturally into clusters for different subject areas _comma_ and indeed Iyer et al. 1994 report positive results from corpus clustering here .
795,3,It will then be able to classify unseen examples .
796,3,Therefore the f-structure reached by each of these paths is identical .
797,5,The derivation trees are built up by the ( complete ) - rule .
798,3,To clarify further the use of the formalism and the operation of the mechanisms _comma_ we now examine several further examples .
799,6,The treatment is easily implementable _comma_ and forms the basis of the ellipsis resolution component currently used within the Core Language Engine Alshawi et al. 1992 .
800,3,The latter comparison is less obvious -- the trade-off between recall and accuracy seems to have reversed _comma_ with no clear winner .
801,3,Presently we are working on the extension of the anaphora module particularly to deal also with the anaphoric definite noun phrases .
802,3,However _comma_ since we are constrained by incrementality _comma_ we will have to make an attachment decision for the PP as soon as the preposition with is encountered _comma_ and it will be attached in the preferred reading as a sister of the verb .
803,3,Moreover _comma_  must be associated with an f-structure node w ' which can also be reached by making a transition from the f-structure node w associated with the mother node of m .
804,2,Secondly _comma_ the task of judging plausibility or anomaly according to context and real world knowledge is a difficult problem _comma_ except in some very limited domains .
805,5,When the frequency of X or Y is zero _comma_ we can not measure their co-occurence likelihood _comma_ and such cases are not exceptional .
806,3,Representing both obligations and goals explicitly allows the system to naturally shift from one mode to the other .
807,5,A basic DCU represents a sentence ( or clause ) _comma_ and complex DCUs are built up from basic and complex DCUs .
808,5,Previous proposals to circumvent the above problem Good 1953 _comma_ Jelinek et al. 1992 _comma_ Katz 1987 _comma_ Church and Gale 1991 take the MLE as an initial estimate and adjust it so that the total probability of seen bigrams is less than one _comma_ leaving some probability mass for unseen bigrams .
809,1,Until now _comma_ research has focused on demonstrations of infants ' sensitivity to various sources ; we have begun to provide quantitative measures of the usefulness of those sources .
810,5,Each reference marker is contraindexed with expressions with which it cannot co-specify .
811,3,The nodes of the and-or tree must be partitioned into equivalence classes dependent on the choice of cutnodes in order to avoid redundant derivations at parse time .
812,3,However _comma_ clustering may also give us significant leverage in monolingual cases .
813,3,F approximates M iff F is a feature structure  _comma_
814,4,These examples indicate that the possible values of case slots depend in general on those of the other case slots : that is _comma_ there exist ` dependencies ' between different case slots .
815,2,However _comma_ our analysis of naturally-occurring consultation dialogues Columbia University Transcripts 1985 _comma_ SRI Transcripts 1992 shows that in other domains conflict resolution does extend beyond a single exchange of conflicting beliefs ; therefore we employ a recursive model for collaboration that captures extended negotiation and represents the structure of the discourse .
816,3,In the latter two cases experiments were carried out both with and without the restrictions on neighbouring cutnodes discussed in the previous section .
817,3,The most laborious part of this work is preparing the training data .
818,3,I claim that a model of the achievement of mutual belief of understanding can be extended to the achievement of other goals in dialogue .
819,4,make it easier to adapt a natural language processing system to a new domain .
820,3,The model theoretic approach to specification languages forces one to think about linguistic ontologies in a systematic way _comma_ and to locate them in a well understood mathematical space .
821,5,If some element of  is realized as a pronoun in _comma_ then so is .
822,3,We will now illustrate how can be used to specify grammars .
823,5,Ranking of an entity on this list corresponds roughly to the likelihood that it will be the primary focus of subsequent discourse ; the first entity on this list is the preferred center _comma_  .
824,3,There does not appear to be an English source of this kind _comma_ so it is planned to compile one .
825,6,The starting point for this work was Scha and Polanyi 's discourse grammar Scha and Polanyi 1988 _comma_ Pruest et al. 1994 .
826,3,Tree 18 _comma_ which is also pointed to by the spelling pattern _comma_ describes the feminine forms of nouns analogously .
827,2,Yet a computational system has no choice but to consider other _comma_ more awkward possibilities -- for example _comma_ this cluster might be capturing a distributional relationship between advice ( as one sense of counsel ) and royalty ( as one sense of court ) .
828,5,For example _comma_ in the bigram models that we study here _comma_ the probability  of a conditioned word that has never occurred in training following the conditioning word is calculated from the probability of _comma_ as estimated by 's frequency in the corpus Jelinek et al. 1992 _comma_ Katz 1987 .
829,3,directional ( like into )
830,3,Bottom-up presentation aims at simulating the unplanned part of proof presentation _comma_ where a proof node or a subproof awaiting presentation is chosen as the next to be presented via the local derivation relations .
831,3,The essential insight is that the choice of a fully inequated feature structure involving a set of nodes is the same thing as the choice of an arbitrary equivalence relation over these nodes _comma_ and this is in turn equivalent to the choice of a partition of the set of nodes into a set of non-empty sets .
832,3,The hierarchy is actually a set of partial orderings of attributes _comma_ represented by lambda expressions _comma_ indexed by object type .
833,4,When the hearer is not confident _comma_ the speaker and hearer collaborate to make a new referring expression that the hearer believes is adequate .
834,3,On the other hand _comma_ if a suggestion was made _comma_ she could instead attempt to expand the plan by affirming or denying the attribute suggested .
835,6,The treatment is similar to the discourse copying analysis of Kehler 1993a _comma_ and to the substitutional treatment suggested by Kamp within Discourse Representation Theory _comma_ described in Gawron and Peters 1990 .
836,5,A classical method is Chow and Liu 's algorithm for estimating a multi-dimensional joint distribution as a dependency tree _comma_ in a way which is both efficient and theoretically sound Chow and Liu 1968 .
837,3,Let us first look at an operator devised for proof segments containing cases .
838,3,It is the role of context and knowledge of the conversants to `` decide '' whether that inference will survive or not as a pragmatic inference of the structure .
839,5,One approach is to encode the salient properties in a static hierarchy as Davis 1989 _comma_ and Reiter and Dale 1992 have done .
840,1,In this paper _comma_ I describe SPATTER _comma_ a statistical parser based on decision-tree learning techniques which constructs a complete parse for every sentence and achieves accuracy rates far better than any published result .
841,2,However _comma_ some careful examination of the experiment is needed .
842,3,Table  shows that performance for generalized context vectors is better than for word-based context vectors ( 0.74 vs. 0.72 ) .
843,3,As far as possible _comma_ simple criteria that can be implemented using the dictionary have been chosen .
844,5,include all optional information that is not already known to the hearer ;
845,2,The best results on unknown words were again obtained on the cascading guesser ( 86 % - 87.45 % ) and Brill 's tagger again did better then the Xerox one by 1.5 .
846,3,This would be the case in query expansion for information retrieval _comma_ for example _comma_ where indiscriminately adding inappropriate words to a query can degrade performance Voorhees 1994 .
847,3,The class guesser _comma_ like the lexicon _comma_ is a finite state transducer .
848,2,Our analysis of Partee 's quantification problem uses a different notion of reference time than that used by the accounts in the exposition above .
849,3,In doing this _comma_ we assume the existence _comma_ for each type of pragmatic inference _comma_ of a set of necessary conditions that must be true in order for that inference to be triggered .
850,3,Note in all the results of DIST-FREE that using distributional information alone favors recall over accuracy ; in fact _comma_ the segmentation hypotheses produced by DIST-FREE have most words broken into single phoneme units with only a handful of words remaining intact .
851,3,This corresponds to the two rules :
852,3,Here we have a 2-place relation not _comma_ which is backed up by the following MP :
853,4,The paradigm of two-level morphology Koskenniemi 1983 has become popular for handling word formation phenomena in a variety of languages .
854,3,Now we explain the semantics of clause which consists of subjective adjective with garu or ta-garu _comma_ that are in categories  and .
855,3,Note that the statement is indeed valid in such models : it is true at all the non-terminal nodes _comma_ and is vacuously satisfied at terminal tree nodes and nodes of f-struct .
856,4,In fact _comma_ with the growing amount of multilingual text corpus data becoming available _comma_ sentence categorization _comma_ leading to multilingual text structure _comma_ opens a wide range of applications in multilingual text analysis such as information retrieval or preprocessing of multilingual syntactic parser .
857,4,How then can we specify this special equivalence in the machine translation dictionary ?
858,4,As is often the case where sense ambiguity is involved _comma_ we as readers impose the most coherent interpretation on the words within the group without being aware that we are doing so .
859,3,Input for this evaluation came from the numbered categories of Roget 's .
860,7,Section  describes a new method for testing hypotheses about effective discourse strategies in dialogue .
861,4,In order to identify structures of a compound noun _comma_ we must first find a set of words that compose the compound noun .
862,3,We define the transition relation using the relation trans/3 .
863,3,We hypothesize that hearers assume that speakers are engaging in Narration in absence of a specific cue to the contrary .
864,4,If a tagged corpus prepared by a human annotator is available _comma_ the transition and lexical probabilities can be estimated from the frequencies of pairs of tags and of tags associated with words .
865,3,The F  data was extracted using the ESPS Waves + package in the Edinburgh University Phonetics Laboratory .
866,2,Secondly _comma_ it is unclear how much the initial biasing contributes the success rate .
867,3,An autodidactic check is now included which speeds up this task .
868,4,Studies on cross-language transfer and cross-language priming have provided evidence for both hypotheses de Groot and Nas 1991 _comma_ Lambert et al. 1958 .
869,3,The effect of phonotactic information can be seen by comparing the average performances of RAND-FREE and RAND-PHONO _comma_ since the only difference between them is the addition of phonotactic constraints on segmentations in the latter .
870,3,It can be argued that the disadvantage of free word order for HMM taggers is compensated for by richer morphology and the additional disambiguation cue of having upper and lower case initial letters to distinguish POS membership .
871,3,For these values _comma_ the improvement in perplexity for unseen bigrams in a held-out 18 thousand word sample _comma_ in which 10.6 % of the bigrams are unseen _comma_ is just over 20 % .
872,3,Our move set includes the following moves :
873,3,FWD_CENTER : Existing threads
874,3,An adequate theory of ellipsis and event reference must account for this distinction .
875,3,It enables us to rely on direct maximum likelihood estimates when reliable statistics are available _comma_ and only otherwise resort to the estimates of an `` indirect '' model .
876,3,We claim that these relations may be further refined by constraints imposed by the coherence relation operative between clauses .
877,3,The conversion of the grammar into Prolog code means that the user of the system can easily develop analysis tools that apply different constraints _comma_ using the tools provided as building blocks .
878,4,Conversation between two people is usually of MIXED-INITIATIVE _comma_ with CONTROL over the conversation being transferred from one person to another .
879,1,In this paper _comma_ we will compare two tagging algorithms _comma_ one based on classifying word types _comma_ and one based on classifying words-plus-context .
880,3,In this paper _comma_ we use ` case slots ' to mean surface case slots _comma_ and we uniformly treat obligatory cases and optional cases .
881,5,It is also possible to get sentences with ` donkey ' readings _comma_ but where the indefinite is in the consequent :
882,4,This example is characterized by its multiple ambiguous pronouns and by the fact that the final utterance achieves a shift ( see figure  ) .
883,3,an introduced observer is the speaker _comma_ and consequently
884,3,Psycholinguistic knowledge would be greatly helpful _comma_ as we believe _comma_ in constructing an artificial language processing system .
885,5,Thus _comma_ the two subjects were obliged to collaborate on constructing descriptions of the figures that would allow them to be unambiguously identified ; for example _comma_ the one that looks like an angel with a stick .
886,3,In the absence of any constraints _comma_ however _comma_ the number of parameters in each of the above three models is exponential ( even the slot-based model has  parameters ) _comma_ and thus it is infeasible to estimate them in practice .

908,5,One solution is to keep to a top-down strategy but to do a breadth-first search _comma_ cf. Kohl 1992 _comma_ which will be fair and not delay the access to the lexicon forever _comma_ as a pure depth-first strategy does .

919,3,A typical schema of SEM of FS of this type is the following .
920,5,One approach is to use a grammar with ` non-standard ' constituency _comma_ so that an initial fragment of a sentence _comma_ such as John likes _comma_ can be treated as a constituent _comma_ and hence be assigned a type and a semantics .
921,6,Specifically _comma_ we view the problem of automatically clustering words as that of estimating a joint distribution over the Cartesian product of a partition of a set of nouns ( in general _comma_ any set of words ) and a partition of a set of verbs ( in general _comma_ any set of words ) _comma_ and propose an estimation algorithm using simulated annealing with an energy function based on the Minimum Description Length ( MDL ) Principle .

935,3,Instead _comma_ all decisions are pursued non-deterministically according to the probability of each choice .
936,3,By looking at the various analyses of sentences in the corpus _comma_ one can see that this rule gives the skeleton for noun phrases _comma_ but from the fraction of coverage of these parses one can also see that it leaves out an important feature _comma_ adjectives _comma_ which are optionally found in noun phrases .
937,3,The possibilities for rhetorical relations ( e.g. _comma_ whether something is narration _comma_ or elaboration _comma_ or a causal relation ) can be further constrained by aspect .

940,2,Minnen et al. 1995 observe that the EAA is computationally infeasible _comma_ because it demands the investigation of almost all possible permutations of a grammar .

946,2,It is hard to see how Dalrymple et al.

983,3,Notice that this grammar models a sentence as a sequence of independently generated nonterminal symbols .
984,2,The mechanism also causes problems for dealing with nested coordination .
985,3,The reduction in theoretical complexity is achieved by placing constraints on the power of the target grammar when operating on instantiated signs _comma_ and by using a more restrictive data structure than a bag _comma_ which we call a target language normalised commutative bracketing ( TNCB ) .

1044,3,This extension enables us to successfully bind the `` she '' in the final utterance of the example in figure  to `` Friedman . ''
1045,2,In such cases a simple top-down parser will be incomplete _comma_ and a left corner parser will resort to buffering the input ( so won't be fully word-by-word ) .

1058,3,( This corresponds to temporal centering 's preference to continue the current thread . )
1059,5,Most deletion accounts assume that deletion is performed under identity of words _comma_ but don't analyse what it means for two words to be identical ( an exception is van Oirsouw who discusses phonological _comma_ morphological and referential identity ) .
1060,5,As described in Grosz et al. 1986 _comma_ the process of centering attention on entities in the discourse gives rise to the intersentential transitional states of continuing _comma_ retaining and shifting .

1072,5,The general dual-coding theory hypothesizes that human represents language with dual systems -- the verbal system and the imagery system .
1073,4,The phonological or orthographic changes involved in affixation may be quite complex _comma_ so dimension  can be large _comma_ and a feature mechanism may be needed to handle such varied but interrelated morphosyntactic phenomena such as umlaut Trost 1991 _comma_ case _comma_ number _comma_ gender _comma_ and different morphological paradigms .
1074,5,Next _comma_ one agent or the other must refashion the referring expression plan in the context of the judgment by either replacing some of its actions ( by using replace-plan ) or by adding new actions to it ( by using expand-plan ) .

1082,3,For these grammars data-driven bottom-up processing is more appropriate .
1083,3,At the current state of the art in statistical natural language processing _comma_ it is best to use a combination of an automatically constructed thesaurus and a hand made thesaurus for disambiguation purpose .
1084,3,In this case the initial model is of better quality than BW can achieve .
1085,3,Induced tree-cutting criteria where the node entropy was taken to be the phrase entropy of the RHS phrase of the dominating grammar rule .
1086,6,We use the framework for the allocation and transfer of control of Whittaker and Stenton 1988 .
1087,2,Although agents involved in argumentation and non-collaborative negotiation take other agents ' beliefs into consideration _comma_ they do so mainly to find weak points in their opponents ' beliefs and attack them to win the argument .
1088,3,Interestingly _comma_ nothing needs to be changed to use the same parser for the computation of the intersection of a FSA and a CFG .
1089,7,The different techniques are experimentally evaluated in section  .
1090,2,The need to figure out such systems as the comparative phonology of various linguistic sites can be very time-consuming and fraught with arbitrary choices .
1091,5,The algorithm and an example is reproduced below .
1092,3,This is not the case .
1093,3,where  is an experimentally-determined interpolation parameter .
1094,3,The attachment of both PPs is then skipped .
1095,4,For example _comma_ expansion at the VP level gives :
1096,4,Non-deterministic search methods have been devised as a way of tackling large-scale combinatorial optimisation problems _comma_ problems that involve finding optima of functions of discrete variables .
1097,3,In terms of a traditional classification _comma_ this would be seen as a ` hybrid symbolic-statistical ' system because it deals with linguistic structure .
1098,3,Slightly more generally _comma_ PLTG can generate the language
1099,3,A tentative experiment on the contribution of using morphological or surface analysis in French and Swedish was therefore carried out .
1100,3,We used SVDPACK to compute the singular value decompositions described in this paper Berry 1992 .
1101,3,Almost all of the remaining errors are misassignments within closed classes _comma_ including well-known errors due to long distance phenomena _comma_ such as those resulting from the confusion of relative pronouns _comma_ demonstrative pronouns and articles in sentences like : die einmal fr die Buchproduktion erfaten Texte or : doch der wollte nicht _comma_ das falle auf .
1102,2,The answer is that :
1103,5,An arrow pointing from  to is called a subordination constraint and means that the formula must not have wider scope than .
1104,4,The most likely analysis will be taken to be the one that contains the most frequent configurations .
1105,3,for each  and each _comma_ if then _comma_ and
1106,3,Discriminant analysis takes a set of precategorized individuals and data on their variation on a number of parameters _comma_ and works out a set discriminant functions which distinguishes between the groups .
1107,1,We investigated the mechanism for changing control between these structures and found that utterance type and not cue words predicted shifts of control .
1108,3,An agent uses his salience hierarchy for two related purposes : the first to determine what is salient in a particular situation _comma_ and the second to determine the adequacy of a description .
1109,5,It repeats this process until no node pair is left unprocessed .
1110,3,a global threshold level may be set to determine the minimum fraction of spanned input that may be covered in a parse _comma_ and
1111,3,As the table also shows _comma_ the best value of  increases as k decreases _comma_ that is _comma_ for lower k a greater weight is given to the conditioned word 's frequency .
1112,3,This further suggests the possibility of a parallel approach to parsing .
1113,3,However _comma_ we argued in section  that our qualitative model suffered from lack of robustness _comma_ from having only the crudest means for choosing between competing hypotheses _comma_ and from being computationally intractable for large vocabularies .
1114,5,Ambiguities are resolved by comparing the strength of associativity between a preposition and a verb and the preposition and a nominal head .
1115,3,After obtaining the optimal rule-sets we performed the same experiment on a word-sample which was not included into the training lexicon and corpus .
1116,3,explains the function of a class of informationally redundant utterances that cannot be explained by other accounts ; and
1117,3,In contrast _comma_ dimensions corresponding to small singular values represent idiosyncrasies _comma_ like the phonological constraint on the usage of `` an '' vs. `` a '' _comma_ and will be dropped .
1118,5,For reason of space we cannot detail our formalism here _comma_ but we intend to present it in the talk .
1119,3,Then  is in Patheq _comma_ and nothing else is .
1120,3,Their product  is the best least square approximation of C by a matrix of rank m : .
1121,5,The translation process consists of three phases :
1122,5,All three parsers accept grammars written in the ANLT formalism Briscoe et al. 1987a _comma_ and the first two are distributed as part of the ANLT package .
1123,1,A system under construction is outlined which incorporates morphological checks ( using new two-level error rules ) over a directed letter graph _comma_ tag positional trigrams and partial parsing .
1124,7,We look further at this issue in the next section .
1125,7,The definitions of noun phrase countability given in Section  _comma_ while useful for analyzing English _comma_ are not sufficient for translating from Japanese to English .
1126,3,Inference of mutual understanding relies upon some evidence _comma_ e.g. the utterance that is made _comma_ and a number of underlying assumptions .
1127,4,FB assigns a probability to every tag on every word _comma_ while Viterbi prunes tags which cannot be chosen because their probability is lower than the ones of competing hypotheses _comma_ with a corresponding gain in computational efficiency .
1128,7,Explanations of the knowledge contained within each grammar principle is given in the following sections .
1129,3,The aim is to fill the unfilled roles in the CSs _comma_ due to anaphora or unattached PPs. To summarize the algorithm is :
1130,3,We conducted some experiments in order to test the effectiveness of this strategy .
1131,7,In this section we characterize the forms being addressed in terms of two features :
1132,2,But these modes are simply the extremes of possibility and to my knowledge _comma_ no previous work has proposed any principles for when to include optional information _comma_ or any way of testing the proposed principles to see how they are affected by the conversants and their processing abilities _comma_ by the task _comma_ by the communication channel _comma_ or by the domain .
1133,3,We use collocations from thesaurus categories that are word abstractions .
1134,5,Litman and Allen 1987 introduced an intentional analysis at the discourse level in addition to the domain level _comma_ and assumed a set of conventional multi-agent actions at the discourse level .
1135,5,This version differs from the current version ( 1.2 ) of the Xerox Tagger as described in Cutting et al. 1992 in that the DDS Tagger accommodates lexicons and class guessers in the form of external finite-state transducers .
1136,3,My conclusion is that the traditional bottom-up technique works better than a typical top-down method .
1137,3,We thank Mr. R. Isotani of NEC Information Technology Res. Labs. for his comments .
1138,3,There seem to be three patterns of behaviour :
1139,4,In text _comma_ various rhetorical patterns are used to clarify the principle of argument .
1140,7,In the next section _comma_ we introduce the facts concerning gapping _comma_ VP-ellipsis _comma_ and non-elliptical event reference that we seek to explain .
1141,4,Note in the above example that the slot of ` from ' and that of ` to ' should be considered dependent and the attachment site of one of the prepositional phrases ( case slots ) can be determined by that of the other with high accuracy and confidence .
1142,3,Instead of grammatical information being localised to the sentence as a whole _comma_ it is localised to a particular word in its particular context : there is no need to consider a pp as a start of a sentence if it occurs at the end _comma_ even if there is a verb with an entry which allows for a subject pp .
1143,3,A `` semantic distance '' rating between the new DCU and each previous thread is determined .
1144,5,This does not impose any condition that the two categories X and Y share anything in common .
1145,3,The key design decision is to compose morphophonological and morphosyntactic information _comma_ but not the lexicon _comma_ when compiling the description .
1146,3,In its explicit dual Case-Explicit a PCA is added to the beginning of the Acts slot _comma_ which produces the verbalization :
1147,3,The result of the learning process is a set of syntactic SRs _comma_ ( verb _comma_ syntactic relationship _comma_ semantic class ) .
1148,5,One of the most effective taggers based on a pure HMM is that developed at Xerox Cutting et al. 1992 .
1149,3,We have made this choice because we want to be able to analyse the performance of the algorithms across different domains .
1150,3,Here this will be made particularly explicit _comma_ with the parser described in terms of just two rules which take a state _comma_ a new word and create a new state .
1151,5,A Wizard of Oz exercise _comma_ carried out to collect data for this task _comma_ was conducted in a similarly rigid way ; thus it is straightforward to divide the training corpus into clusters _comma_ one cluster for utterances immediately following each kind of system query .
1152,3,We consider an extension of cfg in which each nonterminal A is associated with a tree  .
1153,4,If the input structure for generation is provided by another AI-system _comma_ global problems in producing sufficient input information for the generator may occur _comma_ e.g. _comma_ because of translation mismatches in machine translation Kameyama 1991 .
1154,7,An analysis of the types of disambiguation involved in these models is presented in section  .
1155,3,While passage  could be understood as an Explanation on semantic grounds _comma_ the hearer assumes Narration since no other relation is cued .
1156,2,However _comma_ this simplistic method is inefficient ; for instance _comma_ the length of lexical indices are arbitrary with respect to properties of the words themselves ( e.g. _comma_ in Hypothesis 2 _comma_ there is no reason why /jul/ was assigned the index ` 10 ' -- length two -- instead of ` 9 ' -- length one ) .
1157,5,Many theories of semantic interpretation use  - term manipulation to compositionally compute the meaning of a sentence .
1158,5,This sparseness problem is well-known and serious in the co-occurrence statistics .
1159,3,Because this model is highly lexical _comma_ we can hope that the input words will allow effective pruning by limiting the number of search paths having significantly high probabilities .
1160,3,This is because they terminate in a local optimum and the particular one found depends heavily on the starting point in the search _comma_ and there is usually no way of choosing a good starting point .
1161,1,This paper describes a representation and associated compiler intended for two-level morphological descriptions of the written forms of inflecting languages .
1162,5,The explicit definite clause characterization of filtering resulting from Magic compilation allows processor independent and logically clean optimizations of dynamic bottom-up processing with respect to goal-directedness .
1163,3,For each parse _comma_ the heuristic computes a penalty score for each of the features .
1164,3,The results are summarised in table  _comma_ for various corpora _comma_ where F denotes the `` most frequent tag '' test .
1165,5,Several researchers Partee 1984 _comma_ Hinrichs 1986 _comma_ Nerbonne 1986 _comma_ Webber 1988 have sought to explain the temporal relations induced by tense by treating it as anaphoric _comma_ drawing on Reichenbach 's separation between event _comma_ speech _comma_ and reference times Reichenbach 1947 .
1166,6,Following Pereira et al. 1993 _comma_ we measure word similarity by the relative entropy _comma_ or Kullback-Leibler ( KL ) distance _comma_ between the corresponding conditional distributions .
1167,3,We discuss the scanning step for bottom-up Earley deduction and indexing schemes that help avoid useless deduction steps .
1168,1,The aim of the experiment is to determine _comma_ crudely _comma_ whether a bigger tagset is better than a smaller one _comma_ or whether external criteria requiring human intervention should be used to choose the best tagset .
1169,3,As with nearly all clustering problems _comma_ finding a global maximum is impractical .
1170,3,A claim of this paper is that one role of IRU 's is to ensure that these assumptions are supported by evidence _comma_ thus decreasing the defeasibility of the mutual beliefs that depend on them Galliers 1991 .
1171,5,With her extension _comma_ subject pronouns prefer subject antecedents and non-subject pronouns prefer non-subject antecedents .
1172,3,The tape recordings from four dialogues were then transcribed and the analysis conducted on the typewritten transcripts rather than the raw recordings .
1173,4,A dendroid distribution can be represented by a dependency forest ( i.e. a set of dependency trees ) _comma_ whose nodes represent the random variables _comma_ and whose directed arcs represent the dependencies that exist between these random variables _comma_ each labeled with a number of parameters specifying the probabilistic dependency .
1174,4,Word groupings useful for language processing tasks are increasingly available _comma_ as thesauri appear on-line _comma_ and as distributional word clustering techniques improve .
1175,1,In this paper we describe a method for analysing the temporal structure of a discourse .
1176,1,Studying quantities of texts _comma_ we try to understand as well as possible ways to discriminate languages .
1177,3,Figure  shows how a set of such trees can be generated by illustrating the effect of the following production .
1178,4,Consider the following dialogue from the TRAINS corpus Gross et al. 1993 .
1179,3,A shorter version of this paper appears in the Proceedings of the ACL Conference on Applied Natural Language Processing _comma_ Stuttgart _comma_ October 1994 _comma_ and is Association for Computational Linguistics .
1180,5,The value  is the number of different ways a symbol expands under the Lari and Young methodology .
1181,3,Future work should consider more the strategic part of the generation problem _comma_ e.g. try to find heuristics and strategies which handle situations of ` scope mismatch ' where one language has to be more precise with regard to scope than the other .
1182,3,The point is this .
1183,3,These optimizations are direction independent in the sense that they are useful for both generation and parsing .
1184,3,It also supports effective and efficient dialogues by identifying the focus of modification based on its predicted success in resolving the conflict about the top-level belief and by using heuristics motivated by research in social psychology to select a set of evidence to justify the proposed modification of beliefs .
1185,3,This is a combinatorial optimisation problem _comma_ for which two non-deterministic search techniques are provided : a genetic algorithm and a simulated annealing algorithm .
1186,3,Moreover _comma_ the parsing problem also lies within NP _comma_ since for a given grammar G proofs are linearly bound by the length of the string and hence _comma_ we can simply guess a proof and check it in polynomial time .
1187,3,The constraints on PLPATR which we have identified in this paper ensure that these feature values can be manipulated independently of one another and that they behave in a stack-like way .
1188,3,The left and right context vectors are the basis for four different tag induction experiments _comma_ which are described in detail below :
1189,3,The tenses used may not completely specify the implicit temporal relations between the described events .
1190,3,The transition on input of likes is non-deterministic .
1191,3,and describe states and either describes a simple tense state or
1192,5,Gorrell restricts this constraint to Primary structural relations ( i.e. dominance and precedence ) _comma_ while secondary relations ( e.g. thematic and case dependencies ) are not so constrained .
1193,4,For example _comma_ if a natural language understanding system is interfaced with a speech recognition component _comma_ chances are that this compenent is uncertain about the actual string of words that has been uttered _comma_ and thus produces a word lattice of the most promising hypotheses _comma_ rather than a single sequence of words .
1194,2,Previous studies of the discourse structure of multi-participant dialogues have often factored out the role of MIXED-INITIATIVE _comma_ by allocating control to one participant Grosz 1977 _comma_ Cohen 1984 _comma_ or by assuming a passive listener McKeown 1985 _comma_ Cohen 1987 .
1195,3,Note that our purpose for studying SDL is not that it might be in any sense better suited for a theory of grammar ( except perhaps _comma_ because of its simplicity ) _comma_ but rather _comma_ because it exhibits a core of logical behaviour that any richer system also needs to include _comma_ at least if it should allow for non-peripheral extraction .
1196,3,We illustrate the general difficulties encountered with quantitative evaluation .
1197,1,In this paper I show how starting from a definite clause characterization of filtering derived automatically from a logic grammar using Magic compilation _comma_ filter optimizations can be performed in a processor independent and logically clean fashion .
1198,5,Of course _comma_ the necessary precautions have to be taken in order to avoid the confusion between object - and meta-level variables _comma_ cf. Shieber et al. 1990 .
1199,3,Now _comma_ we will apply our notions above to the actual problem of sentence generation .
1200,5,For translation _comma_ a very direct approach using parameters based on surface positions of words in source and target sentences was adopted in the Candide system Brown et al. 1990 .
1201,3,Usually this is the case with irregular words like _comma_ for example _comma_ `` cattle '' which was wrongly guessed as a singular noun ( NN ) but in fact is a plural noun ( NNS ) .
1202,3,Parsing uses fixed-arity term unification .
1203,3,With WSD _comma_ the precision by using co-occurrence vectors from a 20 M words corpus was higher than by using distance vectors from the CED .
1204,1,First _comma_ we wish to extend formal accounts of single utterances produced by single speakers to explain multi-participant _comma_ multi-utterance discourses Pollack 1986 _comma_ Cohen and Perrault 1986 .
1205,3,For training from a hand-tagged corpus _comma_ the model is estimated by counting the number of transitions from each tag i to each tag j _comma_ the total occurrence of each tag i _comma_ and the total occurrence of word w with tag i .
1206,3,We have foreseen the application of the following techniques :
1207,3,The hand tagging of these corpora is quite different .
1208,5,The Foundations for Intelligent Graphics Project ( FIG ) considered various ways in which natural language input could be used within computer aided design systems ( the particular application studied was computer aided kitchen design _comma_ where users would not necessarily be professional designers ) .
1209,2,A more appealing approach is an empirical automatic acquisition of such rules using available lexical resources .
1210,5,The automata may be derived from the rules alone Trost 1990 _comma_ or involve composition with the lexicon Karttunen et al. 1992 .
1211,3,It enforces also that certain PCAs be used to mediate between parts of proofs .
1212,3,The second part of Figure  shows declares how quantifiers are represented _comma_ which are required since the sentences to be processed may have determiners .
1213,4,Similarly _comma_ in many tone languages _comma_ voice pitch alone signals the tense of a verb .
1214,3,Finally _comma_ two implementations -- one for each technique -- are described and then compared using both artificial and real data for sequences of up to 20 tones .
1215,3,Suppose  .
1216,3,We provide the system with default descriptions .
1217,3,In order to solve point d above _comma_ we have foreseen two possibilities :
1218,4,Although not orthogonal to genre-dependent variation _comma_ the variation that relates directly to content and topic is along other dimensions .
1219,3,And hence _comma_ this result increases our understanding of the necessary computational properties of such richer systems .
1220,3,A list of common appearing substitutions was constructed from the development set .
1221,5,Instead _comma_ Katz 's back-off scheme redistributes the free probability mass non-uniformly in proportion to the frequency of _comma_ by setting
1222,3,Verb Phrases _comma_ Sentences _comma_ Segments _comma_ e.g. this _comma_ that _comma_ it .
1223,3,In general _comma_ two methods exist for combining information sources in the MDL paradigm : one is to have absolute requirements on plausible hypotheses ( like our phonotactic constraints ) -- these requirements must be independently learnable ; the other method of combination is to include an information source in the internal representation of hypotheses ( like our distributional information ) -- all components of the representation are learned simultaneously ( see Ellison 1992 _comma_ for an example of multiple components in a representation ) .
1224,3,The resulting HMM had an error rate of 3.14 % .
1225,3,We refer to this formalism as Partially Linear Tree Grammars ( PLTG ) .
1226,3,This formula states that if a path set is R-related to the ( path set corresponding to the ) f-structure for Bill _comma_ then it receives Bill as its meaning .
1227,3,It is possible to define global and local thresholds for the proportion of the spanned input that must be covered by rules ; in this way _comma_ the user of an LHIP grammar can exercise quite fine control over the required accuracy and completeness of the analysis .
1228,3,These conclusions are based partly on an analysis of the mathematical properties of the clusters themselves _comma_ partly on how well they correlate with analyses based on more traditional isogloss techniques _comma_ and partly on how well they compare with previously-published descriptions of dialects in a specific language _comma_ Irish Gaelic .
1229,5,We believe that few adjuncts are going to provide enough evidence in the corpus for creating SRs .
1230,3,Future lines of research will mainly concentrate on improving the local normalization technique by solving the noun sense ambiguity .
1231,3,To conclude _comma_ a few further arguments for this view _comma_ that are independent of any particular proposals for dealing with ellipsis .
1232,3,For a sentence without any explicit connective expressions _comma_ extension relation is set to the sentence .
1233,3,The training set will be indexed in an and-or tree and used to extract the specialized rules .
1234,3,In order to force the choice of the ` best ' parse on to the verb _comma_ the probabilities of theta grids for nouns _comma_ prepositions _comma_ etc .
1235,3,I would like to thank Helmut Schmid of the University of Stuttgart for providing extensions of parameter initialization for the Xerox Tagger and Jean-Pierre Chanod and Lauri Kartunnen of the Rank Xerox Research Laboratory Grenoble for making available the French and English tagged texts and lexicons .
1236,2,Previous comparisons have either focussed on context-free ( CF ) or augmented CF parsing Tomita 1987 _comma_ Billot and Lang 1989 _comma_ or have used relatively small _comma_ limited-coverage unification grammars and lexicons Shann 1989 _comma_ Bouma and van Noord 1993 _comma_ Maxwell and Kaplan 1993 .
1237,5,And to date _comma_ grammar checkers and other programs which deal with ill-formed input usually step directly from spelling considerations to a full-scale parse _comma_ assuming a complete sentence .
1238,3,Some obligation rules based on the performance of conversation acts are summarized in Table  .
1239,3,The task of assigning a set of POS - tags to a word is actually quite similar to the task of document categorisation where a document should be assigned with a set of descriptors which represent its contents .
1240,5,The backward center is a confirmation of an entity that has already been introduced into the discourse ; more specifically _comma_ it must be realized in the immediately preceding utterance _comma_  .
1241,7,We describe the revised semantic framework in Section  _comma_ and work through several examples of non-constituent coordination ( specifically _comma_ right-node raising ) in Section .
1242,5,Following them _comma_ the structure of the so called ( cluase level ) complex sentence is the following shown in Fig.  .
1243,3,As previously described _comma_ the penalty for a skipped word ranges between 0.95 and 1.05 _comma_ depending on the word 's position in the sentence .
1244,3,In particular _comma_ it should be possible to specify relations among morphosyntactic and morphophonological rules and lexical entries ; for the convenience of developers _comma_ this is done by means of feature equations .
1245,3,The parameter  controls the relative contribution of words in different distances from : as the value of increases _comma_ the nearest words to get relatively more weight .
1246,3,We have argued that this is the correct distinction to make _comma_ and have given a treatment of the second issue .
1247,7,In section  _comma_ I examine the assumption that : Propositions representing beliefs and intentions get added to the context by the unilateral action of one conversant .
1248,4,Some attention has been given to how to make such techniques effective ; for example Cutting et al. 1992 suggest ways of training trigram taggers _comma_ and Merialdo 1994 and Elworthy 1994 consider the amount and quality of the seeding data needed to construct an accurate tagger .
1249,4,Briefly _comma_ the context free skeleton of the grammar rules describes the c-structure _comma_ the well-formedness conditions restrict f-structure admissibility _comma_ and the schemata synchronise the information contained in the c - and f-structures .
1250,5,This is equivalent to minimizing the ` data description length ' as defined in Section 3 _comma_ i.e.  .
1251,3,Also with respect to the dependency constraint an optimization of the rules in the grammar is important .
1252,6,In particular we propose to employ an efficient learning algorithm based on the MDL principle to realize this task .
1253,5,Since then _comma_ there have been some promising results from using co-occurrence vectors _comma_ such as word sense disambiguation Schuetze 1993 _comma_ and word clustering Pereira et al. 1993 .
1254,3,The specific accuracies were different in the various tests _comma_ but the overall patterns remained much the same _comma_ suggesting that they are not an artifact of the tagset or of details of the text .
1255,4,Conversely _comma_ it is possible to imagine building a language model in which all probabilities are estimated according to intuition without reference to any real data _comma_ giving a probabilistic model that is not empirical .
1256,3,If now we model the language as consisting of sentences drawn at random from K different subpopulations _comma_ each with its own unigram probability distribution for words _comma_ then the estimated corpus probability is
1257,2,However _comma_ Solomonoff does not specify a concrete search algorithm and only makes suggestions as to its nature .
1258,3,The most common ( accumulated ) error is the confusion of proper nouns and common nouns -- a result of the fact that both proper nouns and common nouns are both capitalized in German .
1259,3,mentioned above .
1260,7,We discuss examples involving intensional verbs in Section  .
1261,3,fs and bs are declared to be constructors for forward and backward slash .
1262,3,Events are included in their location time ( recorded in the DRS as  on the respective markers ) _comma_ while states temporally overlap their location time ( recorded as ) .
1263,3,For each interpretation I and each object u in I _comma_ [ some unique morph abstracts u under I. ] ] I thus write of the abstraction of u under I .
1264,3,This lref _comma_ implicitly suggested by each CoL verb _comma_ can be either the initial location ( as with partir-to leave ; sortir-to go out ) _comma_ or the path ( passer _comma_ traverser-to pass through ) or the final location ( arriver-to arrive ; entrer-to enter ) of the motion .
1265,3,Neighbors with highest similarity according to both left and right context are listed .
1266,1,This paper puts forward an architecture that combines several established NL generation techniques adapted for a particular application _comma_ namely the presentation of ND style proofs .
1267,4,In English _comma_ voice pitch alone can signal the distinction between a statement and a question .
1268,2,However _comma_ such remedies have their drawbacks .
1269,3,A default classifier is stored stored in the dictionary for uncountable nouns and pluralia tanta .
1270,3,From theorem  and proposition .
1271,6,Incremental processing by addition of new items
1272,5,The 3-D approaches and processing strategies use syntactic context more directly _comma_ and it is to these methods which we now turn .
1273,1,The current exploratory study uses control as a parameter for identifying these higher level structures .
1274,3,This brings up the intriguing possibility that we can predict coordination facts from known processing data _comma_ and vice versa .
1275,7,In Section  we describe two types of discourse inference _comma_ namely Common Topic inference and Coherent Situation inference _comma_ and make a specific proposal concerning the interface between these and the syntactic and semantic representations they utilize .
1276,4,The major topic in the development of word-POS guessers is the strategy which is to be used for the acquisition of the guessing rules .
1277,5,That is _comma_ the number of parameters in the models selected by MDL converge to that of the true model Rissanen 1984 .
1278,5,Takubo 1987 divided level A into two levels .
1279,3,By restricting the matrices  _comma_ _comma_ and to their first m # LT k columns ( = principal components ) one obtains the matrices T _comma_ S _comma_ and D .
1280,3,In the present case _comma_ this means that I did do something to it ( whatever `` it is ) _comma_ but what I did was not stealing .
1281,7,In this section _comma_ I use theorem  to show how - given a rational signature that meets reasonable computational conditions - to construct an effective algorithm to decide if a feature structure is satisfiable .
1282,1,In the following sections _comma_ we argue for the appropriateness of processing-conforming default handling .
1283,3,Repeat  and _comma_ until all PPs and anaphors are treated .
1284,3,Eventualities are interpreted with respect to the Rpt - events are taken to follow the current Rpt _comma_ while states include it .
1285,3,From this it is sensible to conclude _comma_ consistently with the results of Briscoe and Carroll 1993 _comma_ that a more complex model of grammar rule interaction might yield better results .
1286,3,This technique does not require specially prepared training data and uses for training the lexicon and word frequencies collected from a raw corpus .
1287,3,The disambiguation accuracy obtained this way was  .
1288,3,As for lhip_success _comma_ but lists only the most specific successful rules ( i.e. those which have themselves succeeded but whose results have not been used elsewhere ) .
1289,5,This is illustrated in Figure  _comma_ where L indicates a low tone and H indicates a downstepped high tone .
1290,3,The class DEICTIC refers to deictic references to material introduced by noun phrases _comma_ whereas the class EVENT refers to material introduced clausally .
1291,3,Given that we are attempting to construct a formalism that will do justice to both the statistical and structural aspects of language _comma_ the features that we would wish to maximize will include the following :
1292,3,The test set will be used to check the coverage of the set of extracted rules .
1293,7,With respect to this task it is discussed
1294,4,For example _comma_ problems during speech recognition of automatic interpretation can lead to results like `` the ( man / men ) will come to the hotel tomorrow '' .
1295,4,In our example the relative pronoun has such a complex type triggering an extraction .
1296,3,We looked at all anaphors ( excluding first and second person ) _comma_ and grouped them into 4 classes .
1297,3,Actually _comma_ with the ontological issues settled it is a relatively simple task to devise suitable specification languages : we simply consider how LFG linguists talk about such structures when they write grammars .
1298,3,Definition 9 .
1299,3,The overall design is as follows .
1300,5,At first glance such a view seems ideally suited to incremental interpretation .
1301,3,The overall reduction in error rate is small _comma_ from 21.4 % to 20.9 % _comma_ because the number of disagreements is small compared with the overall number of errors in our current recognition setup .
1302,3,On the assumption that saw selects for a PP instrumental argument _comma_ we can derive this preference in the present model via the preference to attach as an argument as opposed to an adjunct .
1303,3,In processing a sentence using a lexicalised formalism we do not have to look at the grammar as a whole _comma_ but only at the grammatical information indexed by each of the words .
1304,3,Some tasks require that two agents agree on the reasons for adopting a proposal _comma_ e.g. in order to ensure robustness in situations of environmental change .
1305,3,This is a powerful concept that can be exploited in the effort to squeeze out every available piece of useful information for natural language processing .
1306,1,This paper presents an analysis of temporal anaphora in sentences which contain quantification over events _comma_ within the framework of Discourse Representation Theory .
1307,3,Nothing else is a wff .
1308,4,This should not be confused with the issue of identifying topics _comma_ and choosing criteria that discriminate one topic from another .
1309,3,A more compelling argument for incremental interpretation is provided by considering dialogues involving interruptions .
1310,3,We then combine the other meaning of two candidates with the meanings of Hillary and wanted _comma_ and using Axiom I and R-relations  ) _comma_ _comma_ and we obtain :
1311,3,ONE / SOME _comma_
1312,3,Therefore we can state the following :
1313,3,The sequence of transitions corresponding to John likes Sue being a sentence _comma_ is given in Figure  .
1314,3,Evaluation of the appropriateness of the candidates .
1315,7,In Section  _comma_ we review previous approaches to the semantics of coordination and argument sharing _comma_ and make note of some of their drawbacks .
1316,2,Because linear logic does not have any form of logical contraction ( as is inherent in the approaches discussed earlier ) _comma_ cases where resources are shared appear to be problematic in this framework .
1317,3,Similarly _comma_ verb neologisms belong to the regular conjugation paradigm characterised by the infinitive ending er _comma_ e.g. dballaduriser .
1318,5,Paradigmatic similarity is based on association data extracted from thesauri Morris and Hirst 1991 _comma_ psychological experiments Osgood 1952 _comma_ and so on .
1319,4,Conversation is BIDIRECTIONAL ; there is a two way flow of information between participants .
1320,3,The precision of word sense disambiguation by using co-occurrence vectors from the 1987 Wall Street Journal ( 20 M total words ) was higher than that by using distance vectors from the Collins English Dictionary ( head words + definition words ) .
1321,3,Our system improves upon this simple size metric by computing sizes based on a compact representation motivated by information theory .
1322,3,We predict shifts of attentional state when shifts in control are negotiated and agreed by all participants _comma_ but not when control is seized by one participant without the acceptance of the others .
1323,3,This localization also makes the proposed constraints be compositional ones _comma_ because in the case of deeply embedded complex sentence to identify the referent of each motivated that bridges between a subordinate clause and its main clause _comma_ the constraints we proposed are resolved with computation confined within each clause .
1324,5,It also permits universal quantification and implication in the goals of clauses .
1325,3,One possibility corresponds to the prediction of an s  s modifier _comma_ a second to the prediction of an ( np s ) ( np s ) modifier ( i.e. a verb phrase modifier ) _comma_ a third to there being a function which takes the subject and the verb as separate arguments _comma_ and the fourth corresponds to there being a function which requires an s / np argument .
1326,1,whether the form leaves behind an empty constituent in the syntax _comma_ and
1327,4,A smaller tagset may also mean that more words have only one possible tag and so can be handled trivially .
1328,6,Now I shall show how this general equation relates to the equations for Igbo Liberman et al. 1993 _comma_ reproduced below :
1329,2,As for clustering the sites into dialect areas _comma_ the familiar bottom-up agglomeration method proves superior to top-down partitioning around medoids .
1330,3,This lack of distinction as to whether one or more modifier is expected is actually a necessary prerequisite for performing decidable fully word-by-word incremental interpretation Milward and Cooper 1994 .
1331,3,We do so as follows :
1332,3,This splitting is performed at an early stage by the tokeniser _comma_ before dictionary lookup .
1333,3,Our first task is to mathematically model this ontology _comma_ and to do so as transparently as possible .
1334,3,For example _comma_ the category appropriate for relative clauses with a noun phrase gap would be :
1335,5,The word dictionary is thus linked to the words book _comma_ word _comma_ language _comma_ and alphabetical .
1336,3,First of all _comma_ in our FS _comma_ a semantic content : SEM is basically a soa ( state of affair ) form of situation semantics .
1337,3,Now _comma_ the completeness principle requires that any of these features appearing as an attribute in the value of the pred attribute must also appear as an attribute of the f-structure immediately containing this pred attribute _comma_ and this recursively .
1338,3,Another simpler extension of this research will be to increase the length of the speech samples used .
1339,3,It seems that this kind of tests have a better performance than mutual information when the counts are small _comma_ as it is the case .

1344,3,The well known complexity of parsing is addressed by decomposing the problem _comma_ and then locating one syntactic constituent at a time .
1345,5,Using this scheme _comma_ they predict which unobserved cooccurrences are more likely than others .
1346,3,This demonstrates the versatility of the general model _comma_ since it can be applied to two very different tone languages .
1347,3,Although we introduced the concept of costs and termination was assured _comma_ the efficiency of constructing a parsing tree would be far slower than sequential processing .
1348,3,This version of CLAWS has a dictionary of about 6_comma_300 words only .
1349,5,with the result
1350,3,The listener must believe that the information that the speaker has provided is true _comma_ unambiguous and relevant to the mutual goal .
1351,5,Some intuitive justification for the direction of threading in dynamic semantics is provided by considering appropriate orders for evaluation of propositions against a database : the natural order in which to evaluate a conditional is first to add the antecedent _comma_ and then see if the consequent can be proven .
1352,1,The aim of this paper is to examine the role that training plays in the tagging process _comma_ by an experimental evaluation of how the accuracy of the tagger varies with the initial conditions .
1353,3,On the other hand _comma_ the similarity model makes several mistakes in which a function word is inserted in a place where punctuation would be found in written text .
1354,3,Now _comma_ in natural language negative correlations are an important source of information : the occurrence of some words or groups of words inhibit others from following .
1355,3,These words are added to the lexicon at the end of first iteration when re-estimation is being used _comma_ so that the probabilities of their hypotheses subsequently diverge from being uniform .
1356,3,Such constraints ( for example the completeness constraint ) are usually expressed in English and make reference to specific features ( notably pred ) .
1357,3,This suggests that the temporal information given by tense acts as a weaker constraint on temporal structure than the information given by temporal adverbials .
1358,3,It adds penalties from the root node to the terminal nodes in turn _comma_ to calculate the penalties of all nodes .
1359,3,If the obligation is to say something then we call this a discourse obligation .
1360,4,Speaker A replies with an elaboration of the initial expression _comma_ and B finds that he is now confident _comma_ and so accepts the reference .
1361,3,evaluating the contribution of false positives and error chaining .
1362,1,Explanation-based generalization is used to extract a specialized grammar from the original one using a training corpus of parse trees .
1363,5,With Pruest utilizing a mixed representation ( called syntactic / semantic structures ) and Asher utilizing Discourse Representation Theory constructs _comma_ each defines mechanisms for determining relations such as parallelism and contrast _comma_ and gives constraints on resolving VP-ellipsis and related forms within their more general frameworks .
1364,7,Section  gives the semantics for the notation _comma_ and argues that QLF is best understood as providing descriptions of semantic compositions .
1365,3,I am grateful to John Coleman _comma_ Michael Gasser and Marie South for helpful comments on an earlier version of this paper .
1366,3,Clearly phonotactic constraints are useful _comma_ as both recall and accuracy improve .
1367,3,Next _comma_ each coordinate is changed into its deviation in the vector :
1368,3,As the complement is headed by an uncountable noun it must be embedded in the prepositional complement of a classifier .
1369,3,Preliminary work suggests that the required structures have formal similarities to the structures used in preferential semantics for default and non-monotonic reasoning .
1370,4,Concluding _comma_ the system should extract for each word ( with complements ) having enough number occurrences of use in the corpus and for each of its syntactic complements _comma_ a list of the alternative SRs that this word is imposing .
1371,4,It follows that for any stack  _comma_ if there is a derivation of the substring from ( see tree ) _comma_ then there is a corresponding derivation of from ( see tree ) .
1372,1,We present a plan-based model of how agents collaborate on reference of this sort .
1373,3,Here is our reduction .
1374,3,Initial parameters were obtained by counting transition and symbol frequencies in a manually tagged 24_comma_000 word corpus taken from the newspaper Stuttgarter Zeitung _comma_ that was kindly made available by the University of Stuttgart .
1375,3,While the treatment of ellipsis is hopefully of some value in its own right _comma_ a more general conclusion can be drawn concerning the requirements for a computational theory of semantics .
1376,5,Such notions provide a very firm _comma_ absolute notion of dialecthood : a set of communities either constitutes a dialect area _comma_ or it does not .
1377,3,What sort of event ?
1378,7,The following sections discuss related work _comma_ describe the learning procedure and evaluate it on the Brown Corpus Francis and Kucera 1982 .
1379,4,Of course _comma_ some of omitted pronouns are syntactically resolved .
1380,3,This relation does not impose constraints on the temporal relations between the events beyond those provided by the tenses themselves .
1381,3,Its usefulness for simultaneous interpretation results from its incremental and parallel style of processing .
1382,5,A depth-first realization of this abstract top-down algorithm would work fine as long as the semantic representations of the leaves are always strictly smaller in size as the semantic form of the root node .
1383,5,The TRAINS System Allen and Schubert 1991 is a large integrated natural language conversation and plan reasoning system .
1384,3,In Fig.  italic numbers are the penalties the system imposed on each node of the structure _comma_ and broken lines are the boundary between the nodes imposed different penalty scores .

1386,3,M is a morph  _comma_ and
1387,3,assigning thesaurus categories provides :
1388,2,Many researchers have noted that the absence of mixed-initiative gives rise to two problems with expert systems : They don't allow users to participate in the reasoning process _comma_ or to ask the questions they want answered Pollack et al. 1982 _comma_ Kidd 1985 _comma_ Frohlich and Luff 1989 .
1389,3,To select best performing guessing rule-sets we suggested an evaluation methodology _comma_ which is solely dedicated to the performance of part-of-speech guessers .
1390,4,It seems as though the word only and the focus marker ( indicated here by underlining the stressed word ) combine to add an extra message about what I didn't do .
1391,4,However _comma_ if we try to preserve robustness by adding such rules whenever we encounter an extragrammatical sentence _comma_ the rulebase will grow up rapidly _comma_ and thus processing and maintaining the excessive number of rules will become inefficient and impractical .
1392,3,If we look at types of NL input _comma_ one clear division is between textual and interactive input .
1393,3,First _comma_ it is learnable .
1394,3,In other words _comma_ as for the semantics of the whole complex sentence _comma_ the only role we should deal with is a motivated .
1395,3,In addition _comma_ given the assumptions that we needed to make in order to produce them _comma_ one might wonder to what extent the data is a result of these assumptions .

1397,5,Webber and Joshi 1982 have noted the importance of a cooperative system providing support for its responses .
1398,3,The improvement we achieved for a bigram model is statistically significant _comma_ though modest in its overall effect because of the small proportion of unseen events .
1399,3,For specificity we will take the grammar to be a Definite Clause Grammar ( DCG ) Pereira and Warren 1980 .
1400,4,add a capability to a system that it didn't previously have _comma_
1401,3,To illustrate how a parser can be generalized to accept a FSA as input we present a simple top-down parser .
1402,6,In order to represent grammar rules distributively _comma_ we adopt categorial unification grammar ( CUG ) where each category owns its functional type .
1403,3,Thus rather than estimating the relative likelihood of an utterance interpretation simply by combining fixed probabilities associated with its various characteristics _comma_ we view these probabilities as conditioned by the initial choice of a cluster or subpopulation from which the utterance is to be drawn .
1404,3,Weakly countable nouns will only be countable if used with a denumerator .
1405,2,Unlike previous work _comma_ the algorithm categorizes word tokens in context instead of word types .
1406,5,A general algorithm for least-errors recognition Lyon 1974 _comma_ proposed by G. Lyon _comma_ is to find out the least number of errors necessary to successful parsing and recover them .
1407,3,Temporal adverbials restrict the location time : temporal adverbs introduce a DRS-condition on the location time _comma_ while temporal subordinate clauses introduce a relation between the event time of the subordinate clause and the location time of the main clause .
1408,4,Potentially large feature structures are stored at intermediate steps in the computation _comma_ so that the space requirements of the algorithm are expensive .
1409,3,When a new category is constructed for the antecedent _comma_ any tense resolutions also need to be undone _comma_ since the original ones may no longer be appropriate for the revised category .
1410,3,The sentential symbol S expands to a sequence of X 's _comma_ where X expands to every other nonterminal symbol in the grammar .
1411,3,For example _comma_ the adverb in `` Mc * N. Hester _comma_ CURRENTLY Dean of ... '' and the conjunction in `` to add that _comma_ IF United States policies ... '' have similar immediate neighbors ( comma _comma_ NP ) .
1412,5,By the same way as the subordinate clause case is dealt with _comma_ the zero subject of the main clause  is known to refer to Hanako _comma_ too .
1413,3,For instance _comma_ the ambiguity class for killer is [ NOUN-SG VERB-INF ] .
1414,5,For example _comma_ a syntax tree missing a noun phrase _comma_ such as the following
1415,5,This puts a strong restriction on the shape of semantic analysis rules : one of the leaves must share its semantic form with the root node .
1416,3,Finally _comma_ it is worth noting why it is necessary to use h-lists .
1417,3,We then go on to address how conversational participants co-ordinate moves between these higher level units _comma_ in particular looking at the ways they use to signal the beginning and end of such high level units .
1418,3,An asterisk _comma_ * _comma_ indicates ill-formed strings .

1422,4,We thus can derive Bill misses  as an s from the hypothesis that there is a `` phantom '' np in the place of the trace .
1423,5,As a semantic representation of words _comma_ distance vectors are expected to depend very weakly on the particular source dictionary .
1424,3,What seems to be needed is some kind of language tuning .
1425,3,We show some applications of this solution to additional temporal anaphora phenomena in quantified sentences .
1426,3,We express this as follows :
1427,2,To my knowledge _comma_ all previous work on dialogue has simply assumed that an agent should never tell an agent facts that the other agent already knows .
1428,7,In section  we analyze some data about the performance of an experiment run in a Unix machine _comma_ on a corpus of 800_comma_000 words .
1429,3,Unfortunately _comma_ it is not possible in general to provide a model for partial or total downstep which permits distinct asymptotes for H and L .
1430,4,The following tree is suitable for the sentence Mary thinks John shaves but not for e.g. Mary thinks John coming here was a mistake .
1431,5,In this model _comma_ the initiator has the goal of having the recipient identify the referent _comma_ and so constructs a referring plan given a set of beliefs about what the recipient believes .
1432,3,The decision to consider only immediate neighbors is responsible for this type of error since taking a wider context into account would disambiguate the parts of speech in question .
1433,7,We will now describe some technical details about the derivation of distance vectors .
1434,3,For each morph M _comma_ [ for some interpretation I and some object u in I _comma_ [ M is the abstraction of u under I .
1435,3,One solution to this problem is to prevent a single daughter sharing more than one of its subtrees with the mother .
1436,3,The implementation of best-first search does not combine new items with the chart immediately _comma_ but makes use of an agenda Kay 1980 _comma_ on which new items are ordered in order of descending priority .
1437,3,This is simply achieved by defining the iterated introduction relationships from  as being those corresponding to the chains of introduction relationships from which refine the type to a maximal type .
1438,3,The method for building up the temporal structure of the discourse combines constraints and preferences : we use constraints to reduce the number of possible structures _comma_ exploiting the HPSG type hierarchy and unification for this purpose ; and we apply preferences to choose between the remaining options using a temporal centering mechanism .
1439,3,As described above _comma_ we take grammar induction to be the search for the grammar G ' that optimizes the objective function  .
1440,5,We compared two sets of distance vectors _comma_ one from LDOCE Procter 1978 and the other from COBUILD Sinclair 1987 _comma_ and verified that their difference is at least smaller than the difference of the word definitions themselves Niwa and Nitta 1993 .
1441,3,In cases where the agent does not know the answer _comma_ the obligation to respond may be discharged by some explicit statement of her inability to give the answer .
1442,4,vocalised texts incorporate full vocalisation _comma_ e.g.  tada ' 043 ra for /tada ' 043 ra/ .
1443,3,The formalism yields an algorithm that has been implemented in Common Lisp with Screamer .
1444,5,Sguy 1973 insisted that the concept of dialect boundaries was meaningless _comma_ and his emphasis on the gradience of language similarity has been widely maintained .
1445,3,When the unknown words were made known to the lexicon the accuracy of tagging was detected at 96 - 98 % and 90 - 92 % respectively .
1446,5,Some proposals have been made for subgoal reordering at compile-time _comma_ e.g. Minnen et al. 1993 elaborating on the work by Strzalkowski 1990 .
1447,5,The second aspect psychologists have focused on is the problem of determining the information sources to which infants are sensitive .
1448,3,the effects of actions ;
1449,3,The results of their on - and off-line experiments show clearly that the low attachment ( corresponding to  ) is easiest _comma_ but the middle attachment ( corresponding to ) is most difficult .
1450,4,Firstly _comma_ we believe that there are practical reasons for interest in grammatical specification languages : formal specification seems important ( perhaps essential ) if robust large scale grammars are to be defined and maintained .
1451,2,This account makes reasonably good empirical predictions _comma_ though it does fail for the following examples :
1452,5,Here  is a mapping _comma_ the semantic projection _comma_ that relates f-structures to semantic structures .
1453,3,The performance of both implementations is evaluated and compared on a range of artificial and real data .
1454,3,For instance _comma_ the verb construit and the adverb trs are respectively misspelt as constuit and trs _comma_ and are not properly recognised .
1455,4,The situation is worse _comma_ however _comma_ in Japanese where no spaces are placed between words .
1456,3,But when they directly conflict with the agent 's personal goals _comma_ the agent may choose to violate them .
1457,3,Table  shows an example of a simple salience hierarchy that an agent might have .
1458,3,We use  for membranes .
1459,3,These results will be useful in the next section .
1460,2,At the same time it often remains unclear how these optimizations relate to each other and what they actually mean .
1461,3,The monostratal _comma_ uniform treatment of syntax _comma_ semantics and phonology supports dataflow analysis _comma_ which is used extensively to provide the information upon which off-line compilation is based .
1462,5,In this analysis _comma_ the reference time is an implicit variable _comma_ which is needed in the interpretation of the temporal relation _comma_ but is not part of the quantificational structure .
1463,6,In particular _comma_ Solomonoff proposes the use of the universal a priori probability Solomonoff 1960 _comma_ which is closely related to the minimum description length principle later proposed by Rissanen 1978 .
1464,3,The system is unable to consider correction characters that would be lexical impossibilities .
1465,5,Word stress in English fairly accurately predicts the location of word beginnings Cutler and Norris 1988 _comma_ Cutler and Butterfield 1992 ; Jusczyk et al. 1993a demonstrated that 9-month - olds ( but not 6-month - olds ) are sensitive to the common strong / weak word stress pattern in English .
1466,3,This naturally leads to the question of how best to introduce quantitative modeling into language processing .
1467,3,The correct tag is almost always included in the set allocated _comma_ but more tags than necessary are often proposed .
1468,3,For example _comma_ it may be interesting to separate material which occurs at the start of the input from that appearing elsewhere .
1469,3,In our algorithm _comma_ it is possible to expand the hypothesis grammar _comma_ thus increasing the dimensionality of the parameter space that is being searched .
1470,3,In addition _comma_ the daughters have in common the subtree z .
1471,3,It might be argued that this indicates a flaw in the model being presented here _comma_ since partial and total downstep are widely attested in the literature on tone languages .
1472,3,The notion of ` head ' employed here is connected more closely with processing control than linguistics .
1473,3,If a clause with `` garu / gat-ta '' is a subordinate clause _comma_ the experiencer cannot be identified with a semantic role corresponding to the subject of main clause or higher clause .
1474,3,can occur just-after the TEMPFOC of e if
1475,3,Examination of the dialogues indicated that there seemed to be different types of control shifts : after some shifts there seemed to be a change of topic _comma_ whereas for others the topic remained the same .
1476,5,For example _comma_ if  is converted into the ` donkey ' sentence :
1477,1,We provide an extension to the previous account of LFG semantics Dalrymple et al. 1993b according to which dependencies between f-structures are viewed as resources ; as a result a one-to-one correspondence between uses of f-structures and meanings is maintained .
1478,3,These rules are referred to individually by preceding their name by the `  ' symbol .
1479,3,All of the assumptions start out supported by no evidence ; their evidence type is therefore hypothesis .
1480,3,That is _comma_ we state in which trees and feature structures are admissible _comma_ and how tree and feature based information is to be synchronised ; examples will be given shortly .
1481,3,A second experiment was conducted to decide when it is appropriate to use Baum-Welch re-estimation at all .
1482,4,Therefore _comma_ during Japanese-English translation _comma_ where analysis _comma_ transfer _comma_ and generation are performed in a parallel and incremental way _comma_ the system has to commit _comma_ e.g. _comma_ positive value before knowing the actual polarity .
1483,5,Shieber 1988 gave the first use of Earley 's algorithm for generation _comma_ but this algorithm does not use the prediction step to restrict feature instantiations on the predicted phrases _comma_ and thus lacks goal-directedness .
1484,3,This has at least two advantages .
1485,3,One can see clear differences between the nearest neighbors in the two spaces .
1486,4,Such methods use statistics on the relative frequencies of configurations of elements in a training corpus to evaluate alternative analyses or interpretations of new samples of text or speech .
1487,1,An innovative approach to HPSG processing is described that uses an off-line compiler to automatically prime a declarative grammar for generation or parsing _comma_ and inputs the primed grammar to an advanced Earley processor .
1488,3,The output is an ordered sequence of proof communicative act intentions ( PCAs ) .
1489,3,the learning of such rules is done from the lexicon rather than tagged corpus _comma_ because the guesser 's task is akin to the lexicon lookup ;
1490,4,In addition _comma_ there is no grammatical marking of countability .
1491,4,In recent years psycholinguistic evidence for incremental interpretation has become more and more compelling _comma_ suggesting that humans perform semantic interpretation before constituent boundaries _comma_ possibly word by word .
1492,3,However _comma_ there are many pairs or triples of clusters that should be collapsed into one on linguistic grounds .
1493,5,He then uses the discounted frequency in the conditional probability calculation for a bigram :
1494,3,Our type of clustering _comma_ then _comma_ is based on the assumption that the utterances to be modeled _comma_ as sampled in a training corpus _comma_ fall more or less naturally into some number of clusters so that words or other objects associated with utterances have probability distributions that differ between clusters .
1495,3,T0 Un-degraded transition probabilities _comma_ calculated from  .
1496,3,Furthermore _comma_ by capturing collaborative negotiation in a cycle of Propose-Evaluate-Modify actions _comma_ the evaluation and modification processes can be applied recursively to capture embedded negotiation subdialogues .
1497,3,We thank Ms. Y. Yamaguchi of NIS for her programming effort .
1498,3,In such a case _comma_ the two-level model succeeds in finding two-level analyses of the word in question _comma_ but fails when parsing the word morphosyntactically : at this stage _comma_ the parser is passed a root _comma_ vocalism and pattern whose feature structures do not unify .
1499,4,The algorithm is again described by Cutting et al. and by Sharman _comma_ and a mathematical justification for it can be found in Huang et al. 1990 .
1500,3,the experiencer cannot be the speaker .
1501,3,In this case _comma_ the system selects sentence one _comma_ two _comma_ three and six for the longest abstract _comma_ and and also could select sentence one _comma_ two and six as a shorter abstract _comma_ and also could select sentence six as a still more shorter abstract .
1502,5,In this case the extraction process is invoked recursively to extract subrules rooted in the current node .
1503,5,Moreover Hanako who is marked by ` wa ' is regarded as the topic for these two clauses .
1504,4,Whereas an ordinary word-graph always defines a finite language _comma_ a FSA of course can easily define an infinite number of sentences .
1505,2,it relocates information from mental states to the environment in which utterances occur ;
1506,3,This probably means that in a large number of cases there was no potential conflict of co-specifiers .
1507,3,Since N = ( T c ) _comma_ higher-order unification is used by  -Prolog to instantiate T by extracting c from N with the result .
1508,5,The quantificational structure of such sentences can be analyzed either by an iteration of monadic quantifiers _comma_ or as a single dyadic quantifier of type  .
1509,3,We refer to the code length for the model as the ` model description length ' and that for the data the ` data description length ' .
1510,5,The second is to use a calculus in which types can undergo ` type-raising ' Dowty 1988 _comma_ or can be formed by abstraction ( as in the Lambek Calculus _comma_ Lambek 1958 ) .
1511,3,We start by constructing representations of the syntactic behavior of a word with respect to its left and right context .
1512,3,Table  shows the SRs corresponding to the subject position of the verb seek .
1513,4,One particular situation in which this arises is in giving directions .
1514,3,Incorporating this method into the machine translation system ALT-J / E _comma_ helped to raise the percentage of noun phrases generated with correct use of articles and number from 65 % to 73 .
1515,3,Garu roughly means `` show a sign of '' or `` behave like .. ing '' Ohye 1975 .
1516,3,Again _comma_ interpretation seen as description building sits easily with this .
1517,5,Functional types included a list of arguments to the left _comma_ and a list of arguments to the right .
1518,3,The remaining sample is a set of 5 human-human _comma_ keyboard-mediated _comma_ task-oriented dialogues about the assembly of a plastic water pump Cohen 1984 .
1519,7,whether the expression is anaphoric in the semantics .
1520,3,Indeed _comma_ verbs like sortir intrinsically suggest a location of which we have gone out .
1521,3,Thus increases in the size of a grammar don't necessarily effect efficiency of processing _comma_ provided the increase in size is due to the addition of new words _comma_ rather than increased lexical ambiguity .
1522,2,Third _comma_ though perhaps less importantly _comma_ higher-order unification going beyond second-order matching is required for resolving ellipses involving quantification .
1523,5,When we consider threading of possible worlds _comma_ as in Update Semantics Veltman 1990 _comma_ the need to distinguish between the order of evaluation and the order of presentation becomes more clear cut .
1524,5,Probabilities are assigned by the following inductive definition :
1525,3,The implementation is fast _comma_ small _comma_ robust and textual errors tolerant .
1526,5,Acting as hearer _comma_ one copy of the system performs plan inference on each set of surface speech actions that it observes _comma_ and updates the state of the collaboration .
1527,4,Briefly _comma_ the up - and down-arrows in the schemata can be read as follows :  denotes the value of Feature in the f-structure associated with the tree node immediately dominating the current tree node _comma_ whereas denotes the value of Feature in the f-structure associated with the current tree node .
1528,3,To collaborate _comma_ the agents use judgment _comma_ suggestion _comma_ and elaboration moves to refashion the referring expression until they mutually believe that the recipient has understood .
1529,4,Otherwise there would be a simpler proof without this abstraction .
1530,3,Several follow-up experiments were used to confirm the results : using corpora from the Penn treebank _comma_ using equivalence classes to ensure that all lexical entries have a total relative frequency of at least 0.01 _comma_ and using larger corpora .
1531,5,The sentence is false in the case where out of ten women _comma_ one owns 50 cats and is happy _comma_ while the other nine women own only one cat each _comma_ and are miserable .
1532,3,The general pattern of the results is similar across the three test corpora _comma_ with the only difference of interest being that case D3 + T0 does better for LOB-L than for the other two cases _comma_ and in particular does better than cases D0 + T1 and D1 + T1 .
1533,5,Such an approach allows for the treatment of missing _comma_ extraneous _comma_ interchanged or misused words Teitelbaum 1973 _comma_ Saito and Tomita 1988 _comma_ Nederhof and Bertsch 1994 .
1534,3,From our perspective _comma_ it can be seen as a quantitative version of the logic-based model because both models attempt to capture similar information ( about the organization of words into phrases and relations holding between these phrases or their referents ) _comma_ though the tools of modeling are substantially different .
1535,3,Worse still _comma_ in a long sentence it will join determiners from the start of the sentence to nouns that occur in the latter half of the sentence .
1536,3,Considering this informally in terms of tree structures _comma_ what is happening is the replacement of an empty node in a partial tree by a second partial tree i.e.
1537,3,Even more homogeneity is introduced to an incremental system if the default descriptions are given in terms of input specifications .
1538,4,Second _comma_ there is a class of techniques for learning rules from text _comma_ a recent example being Brill 1993 .
1539,3,Unlike a simple Markov process _comma_ there are a potentially infinite number of states _comma_ so there is inevitably a problem of sparse data .
1540,3,In Test  _comma_ ALT-J / E 's semantic hierarchy is used to test whether a sentence is generic or not .
1541,3,The weight is larger for words that are more similar ( closer ) to  .
1542,3,However _comma_ preliminary experiments using such measures as the Kullback-Liebler distance between the initial and new models have again showed that it does not give good predictions of accuracy .
1543,5,Soft clustering has several desirable properties .
1544,3,If possible _comma_ she should use the suggestion to elaborate the plan _comma_ thus avoiding unwanted conversational implicature _comma_ but its use may not be enough to make the plan adequate .
1545,3,The decisions under consideration involve identifying constituents and constituent labels in natural language sentences .
1546,3,We have so defined a structuration of the space based on 4 zones :
1547,3,Syntactic categories are italicised _comma_ while terminals are underlined : `  ' .
1548,3,Now _comma_ a model is simply a mathematical embodiment of LFG sentence structure _comma_ thus those models  in which is valid are precisely the sentence structures which embody all our grammatical principles .
1549,3,The translations before the proposed processing was implemented are marked OLD _comma_ the translations produced by ALT-J / E using the proposed processing are marked NEW .
1550,3,Syntactic relationship codes the kind of complement : 0 subject _comma_ 1 object _comma_ or preposition in case it is a PP .
1551,3,The acquired SR is correct according to the noun senses contained in the corpus .
1552,4,Semitic languages employ a large number of diacritics to represent enter alia short vowels _comma_ doubled letters _comma_ and nunation .
1553,3,Errors in an utterance may cause misunderstanding .
1554,5,But _comma_ if the actual semantic decomposition takes place in the lexicon _comma_ the semantic representations of some subgoals will be variables _comma_ which stand for semantic representations of any size :
1555,3,The process is depicted in fig.  .
1556,3,a reference text with correctly assigned POS tags _comma_
1557,2,For example _comma_ Lakoff and Peters 1969 argued that deletion accounts are inappropriate for certain constituent coordinations such as :
1558,3,Recall is the number of correct tokens divided by the total number of tokens of t ( in the first column ) .
1559,3,For example _comma_ in the following sentence  _comma_ the event triggers the introduction of an event marker e _comma_ and location time marker t _comma_ into the DRS with the DRS-condition .
1560,3,We provide a syntactic definition ( below ) of a LHIP grammar rule _comma_ using a notation with syntactic rules of the form  which indicates that the category C may take any of the forms to .
1561,3,For each tag t _comma_ the table lists the frequency of t in the corpus ( `` frequency '' ) _comma_ the number of induced tags  _comma_ that were assigned to it ( `` # classes '' ) ; the number of times an occurrence of t was correctly labeled as belonging to one of ( `` correct '' ) ; the number of times that a token of a different tag was miscategorized as being an instance of ( `` incorrect '' ) ; and precision and recall of the categorization of t .
1562,5,An interesting model is described by Airenti et al. 1993 _comma_ which separates out the conversational games from the task-related games in a way similar way to Litman and Allen 1987 .
1563,5,The most obvious way to make a knowledge source more accurate is to increase the amount of structure or context that it takes account of .
1564,3,This paper has mainly focused on cases where the IRU :
1565,3,The TNCB implied by the bracketing in  is equivalent to that in figure and requires just one rewrite in order to make it well-formed .
1566,5,For example _comma_ on parsing the sentence _comma_
1567,3,Disjunction is expressed by ` ; ' _comma_ and optional RHS clauses are surrounded by ` ( ?.? ) ' .
1568,3,In fact _comma_ it helps explain infants ' ability to learn words from parental speech : these two sources alone are useful and infants have several others _comma_ like prosody and word stress patterns _comma_ available as well .
1569,3,The hand-coded operationality criteria result in an average rule length of four _comma_ and a distribution of reduction lengths that is such that only 17 percent are of length one and 11 percent are of length two .
1570,3,The heuristic is successful in labeling 21 of the 25 bad parses as `` bad '' .
1571,5,where the quantifier introduced by the subject does not in fact have maximal scope ( an analysis I have argued for elsewhere Ramsay 1992a ) .
1572,3,A feature plus or minus tensed verb on each conjunct does block them _comma_ but is difficult to motivate .
1573,5,Existing dialogue systems have two modes for dealing with optional information :
1574,3,However there is a major problem .
1575,3,Portions of an input string can be analysed as soon as they are produced ( or generated as soon as the what-to-say component has decided to verbalize them ) _comma_ even for grammars where one cannot assume that the left-corner has been predicted before it is scanned .
1576,4,Furthermore for each transition  we have a rule .
1577,3,For the low level structures we identified _comma_ ( i.e. control phases ) _comma_ cue words and phrases were not as reliable in predicting shifts .
1578,3,Morphology also needs to be well integrated with other processing levels .
1579,3,In our case _comma_ we define precision as the proportion of triples appearing in syntactic positions with acquired SRs _comma_ which effectively fulfill one of those SRs .
1580,3,And _comma_  is activity given from outside ( at time T ) ; to ` activate a node ' is to let .
1581,3,Each introduction relationship has a probability  and the probabilities for all the introduction relationships that apply to a given non-maximal type must sum to one .
1582,3,In the actual clustering step _comma_ traditional agglomerative clustering works better than the top-down technique of partitioning around medoids .
1583,3,We opt for a particularly simple specification language : a propositional language enriched with operators for talking about c - and f-structures _comma_ together with a path equality construct for enforcing synchronisation between the two domains .
1584,3,The second of these is perhaps the most interesting _comma_ and is given in Figure  .
1585,3,Rather _comma_ obligations are the result of rules by which an agent lives .
1586,3,The other rows ( for describing intersections ) follow similarly .
1587,6,This distinction between planned and unplanned presentation leads to a very natural segmentation of the discourse into an attentional hierarchy _comma_ since _comma_ following the theory of Grosz and Sidner 1986 _comma_ there is a one-to-one correspondence between the intentional hierarchy and the attentional hierarchy .
1588,5,Begin at the NP node immediately dominating the pronoun in the parse tree of S .
1589,5,Another way of allowing pragmatic inferences to be cancelled is to assign them the status of defeasible information .
1590,3,The requirement that this should have maximal scope will ensure that X is the last free variable in W .
1591,5,This problem has been investigated in the area of machine learning and related fields .
1592,5,No pretagged text is necessary for Hidden Markov Models Jelinek 1985 _comma_ Cutting et al. 1991 _comma_ Kupiec 1992 .
1593,3,For purposes of evaluation _comma_ test instances for which the judge had low confidence ( i.e. confidence ratings of 0 or 1 ) were excluded .
1594,2,Moreover _comma_ the interchanging of arguments in recursive procedures as proposed by Strzalkowski fails to guarantee that input and output grammars are semantically equivalent .
1595,4,The major difficulties in sentence categorization are convergence and textual errors .
1596,3,The initial grammar is listed in Table  .
1597,5,In the CCG formalism _comma_ the derivation is as follows : harry gets raised with the # GT T rule _comma_ and then forward composed by the # GT B rule with found _comma_ and the result is a category of type s / np with LF  .
1598,2,However _comma_ no method for extracting the relationships from superficial linguistic expressions was described in their paper .
1599,3,The resulting grammar is equivalent to AB Categorial Grammar plus associativity .
1600,3,D2 Lexical probabilities are proportional to the overall tag frequencies _comma_ and are hence independent of the actual occurrence of the word in the training corpus .
1601,5,For a given n _comma_ we create a probabilistic context-free grammar consisting of all Chomsky normal form rules over the n nonterminal symbols  and the given terminal symbols _comma_ that is _comma_ all rules
1602,5,Likewise _comma_ Bill gets the LF  _comma_ and coordination results in the following LF for John and Bill :
1603,3,These axioms are based on the lexical semantics of CoL verbs and of spatial prepositions .
1604,5,These range from temporal instants in Tense logic Prior 1967 _comma_ through intervals of time Bennet and Partee 1978(1972) as in the analysis of temporal connectives in Heinmki 1978 _comma_ to event structures Kamp 1979 as in Hinrichs 1986 's analysis of temporal anaphora .
1605,4,This need motivates research on fully automatic text processing that may rely on general principles of linguistics and computation _comma_ but does not depend on knowledge about individual words .
1606,4,As a preliminary to this work _comma_ note that it is hard to reason about the effect of changing the tagset .
1607,3,However _comma_ even if we can incorporate the required preferences into the parser _comma_ the constraint of incrementality will force us to make the decision on encountering that .
1608,3,All our experiments involve the asymmetric model described in the previous section .
1609,3,The sentence parsed at the first level returns :
1610,3,Then we have :
1611,3,kleene star is used only in a very limited context ( for the analysis of coordination ) _comma_
1612,3,As a baseline _comma_ ten runs were done selecting senses by random choice _comma_ with the average percent correct being 34.8 % _comma_ standard deviation 3.58 .
1613,1,In this paper _comma_ we have attempted to construct an algorithm for fully automatic distributional tagging _comma_ using unannotated corpora as the sole source of information .
1614,3,We begin by identifying all shifts of control in the dialogue and then look at how each shift was signalled by the speakers .
1615,3,Before describing how we adapt this technique to the case of PLPATR we discuss the sense in which PLPATR derivations exhibit a `` context-freeness '' property .
1616,3,R unifies with the  function _comma_ S with harry ' and M with ( R S ) _comma_ the meta-level application of R to S _comma_ which by the built-in - reduction is .
1617,3,It is shown that for a large class of grammars the subsumption check which often influences processing efficiency rather dramatically can be eliminated through fine-tuning of the magic predicates derived for a particular grammar after applying an abstraction function in an off-line fashion .
1618,3,This is a standard way of viewing feature structures _comma_ and is appropriate for LFG .
1619,2,This paper reviews the theoretical literature _comma_ and shows why many of the theoretical accounts actually have worse coverage than accounts based on processing .
1620,4,To illustrate this _comma_ consider the sentence :
1621,3,This means that _comma_ in cases such as  _comma_ where _comma_ on the globally acceptable reading _comma_ the PP is an adjunct of the NP the man _comma_ this attachment will have to be revised _comma_ and the PP retrospectively adjoined into the relevant N ' node .
1622,3,PET will give one of three responses to this word ; it will accept the word _comma_ suggest a correction _comma_ or indicate that it found an error it couldn't correct .
1623,3,Despite their apparent importance to translation _comma_ the quantitative system can avoid the use of word sense symbols ( and the problems of granularity they give rise to ) by exploiting statistical associations between words in the target language to filter implicit sense choices .
1624,4,In  the corrected material tells us that the man is both old and has a wife .
1625,3,Naturally _comma_ compilation may induce left-recursion as well as eliminating it _comma_ in which case LHIP will suffer from the same termination problems as an ordinary DCG formalism interpreted in this way .
1626,3,Thus it is likely that the target joint distribution can be approximated reasonably well by the product of component distributions of low order _comma_ drastically reducing the number of parameters that need to be considered .
1627,5,The network is a graph that shows which words are used in the definition of each word Nitta 1988 .
1628,4,For example _comma_ the Syriac root { ktb } takes the perfect vowel a _comma_ e.g. /ktab/ _comma_ while the root  takes the vowel e _comma_ e.g. .
1629,3,Information theoretic tools can be used to find the entropy of different tag sequence languages _comma_ and support decisions on representation .
1630,3,This is clear for  _comma_ but it also holds for if we want to interpret a sentence like a man stole a bike as
1631,2,A more recent attempt can be found in THINKER Edgar and Pelletier 1993 _comma_ which implements several interesting but isolated proof presentation strategies _comma_ without giving a comprehensive underlying model .
1632,3,If no suggestion was made _comma_ then she can expand the plan according to her own beliefs about the referent 's attributes and their salience .
1633,3,The first is that the lookup predicate should not have to be specified by the user _comma_ but automatically inferred from the program .
1634,3,This will be the subject of future experiments .
1635,3,If the listener believes that the speaker 's assertion is relevant but ambiguous then interrupt .
1636,4,As suggested by an ACL reviewer _comma_ one could also try to model haplology phenomena ( such as the 's in English sentences like ` The chef at Joe 's hat ' _comma_ where ` Joe 's ' is the name of a restaurant ) using a finite state transducer .
1637,3,As an additional test _comma_ we tried assigning the most probable tag from the D0 lexicon _comma_ completely ignoring tag-tag transitions .
1638,3,Though the form in which the vector is written may give an illusion of representing order _comma_ no sequential order is maintained .
1639,5,Gerdemann 's generator follows a head-driven strategy in order to avoid inefficient evaluation orders .
1640,2,However treating the sentence as a basic unit loses meaning when the ` sentence ' is incomplete or illformed .
1641,5,Most other work on clustering for language modeling Pereira et al. 1993 _comma_ Net et al. 1994 has addressed the problem of data sparseness by clustering words into classes which are then used to predict smoothed probabilities of occurrence for events which may seldom or never have been observed during training .
1642,3,Test instances consisted of a noun group ( i.e. _comma_ all the nouns in a numbered category ) together with a single word in that group to be disambiguated .
1643,3,In this way _comma_ the strictness of a rule may be varied according to information originating either within the particular run-time invocation of the rule _comma_ or elsewhere in the current parse .
1644,2,While evidence exists that infants are sensitive to these information sources _comma_ we know of no measurements of their usefulness .
1645,3,It seems that the status of the Cp of  should be as important in this case as it is in determining the retaining / chontinuing distinction .
1646,5,For example _comma_ likes and Mary can be combined to get the type c   c .
1647,4,Instead of thinking of John gave and by Chomsky as deleted _comma_ we can also think of them as shared by the two conjuncts .
1648,3,Conversants must provide evidence of a detected discrepancy in belief as soon as possible .
1649,1,The paper described some potential applications of incremental interpretation .
1650,3,Since constraint satisfaction method in UG has been and is developed by many researchers recently i.e. Tsuda 1991 _comma_ our theory will be able to be implemented in systems like theirs .
1651,5,Then _comma_ the topic Hanako is the strongest candidate for the backward center of the subordinate clause .
1652,3,An adjective like `` likely '' is very similar to `` seemed '' in this respect although its left context is quite different from that of `` seemed '' .
1653,3,Negative estimates were neglected because they are mostly accidental except when X and Y are frequent enough Church and Hanks 1989 .
1654,3,This will match with the first clause for coord _comma_ with
1655,3,In particular _comma_ though both algorithms employ a greedy hill-climbing strategy _comma_ our algorithm gains an advantage by being able to add new rules to the grammar .
1656,3,Furthermore the paper benefitted from remarks made by the anonymous ACL reviewers .
1657,3,When analyzing the coverage of WordNet taxonomy we considered two different ratios .
1658,1,In this paper _comma_ we propose a method to analyze structures of Japanese compound nouns by using word collocational information and a thesaurus .
1659,1,In this paper _comma_ I report two experiments which address the internal design criterion _comma_ by looking at how tagging accuracy varies as the tagset is modified _comma_ in English _comma_ French and Swedish .
1660,3,The discussion of built-in predicates mentioned facilities for recovering partial parses .
1661,5,The accuracy of their method is 73 % in identifying correct structures of kanzi character sequences with average length is 4.2 characters .
1662,3,For each feature structure F _comma_ [ F is satisfiable iff F approximates some morph .
1663,3,Linguistic actions are different than physical actions .
1664,3,The existence of a parser and a generator that can map between the two forms is assumed .
1665,3,Since a participant must interrupt if any condition for an interrupt holds _comma_ then lack of interruption signals that there is no discrepancy in mutual beliefs .
1666,3,In the future _comma_ hopefully with larger training data size _comma_ we plan to construct larger thesauri as well as to test other clustering algorithms .
1667,3,Definition 5 .
1668,3,The first step in the analysis _comma_ the computation of linguistic distance between each pair of sites _comma_ can be computed as Levenshtein distance between phonetic strings .
1669,3,These programs can be adapted to other tone languages by adjusting the F  prediction function .
1670,4,If one assumes a pairwise linking from left to right then the links between the two trees can be omitted .
1671,2,Essentially _comma_ the logic variable X is meant to be interpreted as a bound variable _comma_ which requires an additional layer of programming .
1672,6,In applying MDL _comma_ we usually assume that the given data are generated by a probabilistic model that belongs to a certain class of models and selects a model within the class which best explains the data .
1673,5,This model views collaborative planning as agent A proposing a set of actions and beliefs to be incorporated into the shared plan being developed _comma_ agent B evaluating the proposal to determine whether or not he accepts the proposal and _comma_ if not _comma_ agent B proposing a set of modifications to A 's original proposal .
1674,5,Therefore the backward center of the subordinate clause is Hanako _comma_ and consequently zero subject  refers to Hanako .
1675,2,Because of data sparseness _comma_ we cannot reliably use a maximum likelihood estimator ( MLE ) for bigram probabilities .
1676,3,The collocational information is acquired from a corpus of four kanzi character words .
1677,3,B instantiated to s
1678,2,In DRT _comma_ such sentences trigger box-splitting with the eventuality of the subordinate clause and an updated reference time in the antecedent box _comma_ and the eventuality of the main clause in the consequent box _comma_ causing undesirable universal quantification over the reference time .
1679,3,The proposed model is intended to serve as a tool for phonologists working on instrumentally obtained pitch data from tone languages .
1680,3,The most lenient is whether or not the subject and head markers are placed correctly - the type of measure used in the IBM / Lancaster work Black et al. 1993 .
1681,3,Moreover the notation  stands for
1682,5,A number of researchers Grosz and Sidner 1986 _comma_ Brennan et al. 1987 _comma_ Guindon et al. 1986 _comma_ Reichman 1985 have given accounts of how these relate to the continuing _comma_ retaining or shifting of focus .
1683,3,For example _comma_ we can say courir sur place-to run in place .
1684,3,For start states _comma_ the relation start/1 should hold _comma_ and for final states the relation final/1 should hold .
1685,4,A description is an entity that can be interpreted as true or false of an object .
1686,3,We assume that the target model can be defined in the following way .
1687,4,Bidirectionality of grammar is a research topic in natural language processing that is enjoying increasing attention Strzalkowski 1993a .
1688,3,Moreover _comma_ they can utilise more of the implicit information in the training data by modelling negative relationships .
1689,3,In addition a number of these forms may also be used as finite verbs ( i.e. erhalten _comma_ gehrt ) _comma_ and this is a further source of errors .
1690,3,Thus we demand that the following conditional statement be valid :
1691,3,Selection of the most appropriate subset of the candidate space to convey the SRs _comma_ taking into account that the final classes must be mutually disjoint .
1692,4,The acquisition of case frame patterns normally involves the following three subproblems :
1693,4,To tag a text _comma_ the tags with non-zero probability are hypothesised for each word _comma_ and the most probable sequence of tags given the sequence of words is determined from the probabilities .
1694,3,To generate this the following rule is used : `` nouns quantified with the classifier kire `` slice '' will be generated as the prepositional complement of slice _comma_ they will be singular with no article unless they are pluralia tanta _comma_ when they will be plural with no article '' .
1695,3,This can be done directly _comma_ by measuring the distance between distributions of the form  _comma_ corresponding to different bigrams .
1696,3,Due to space restrictions _comma_ we only show the following piece of a preverbal message as an example _comma_ being a PCA enriched with reference choices for reasons and method by the microplanner Huang 1994b _comma_ Huang 1994b .
1697,3,This collection process yielded 1112041 verb-object pairs .
1698,6,As mentioned _comma_ this work employs the Bayes -ian grammar induction framework described by Solomonoff 1960 _comma_ Solomonoff 1964 .
1699,3,This can most easily be seen by noting that the number of states visited by a deterministic LR parser equals the number of shift actions plus the number of reductions _comma_ and equals the number of nodes in the corresponding parse tree _comma_ and the longer the reductions _comma_ the more shallow the parse tree .
1700,3,We must have some well-defined method of measuring hypothesis sizes for this method to work .
1701,4,is a conjunction of two pairs of noun phrases .
1702,3,Fourth _comma_ the generated abstract is composed of rhetoricaly consistent units which consist of several sentences and form a rhetorical substructure .
1703,4,So _comma_ the bulk of written sentences are open to the extragrammaticality .
1704,3,This has allowed us to classify CoL verbs into 10 classes on the basis of which zones the mobile is inside _comma_ at the beginning and at the end of its motion .
1705,3,However just parsing syntactically is not enough for natural language understanding .
1706,3,Future work will investigate the effect of training the networks on the positive examples alone .
1707,3,We assume the process of natural language recognition as follows .
1708,3,Two comparisons are needed to show that the combination of distributional and phonotactic information performs better than either source alone : DIST-PHONO compared to RAND-PHONO _comma_ to see the effect of adding distributional analysis to phonotactic constraints _comma_ and DIST-PHONO compared to DIST-FREE _comma_ to see the effect of adding phonotactic constraints to distributional analysis .
1709,3,We distinguish three kinds of referentiality : ` generic ' _comma_ ` referential ' and ` ascriptive ' .
1710,5,Similarly _comma_ threading from the antecedents of conditionals into the consequent fails for examples such as :
1711,4,A method of constructing a thesaurus based on corpus data usually consists of the following three steps :
1712,3,However _comma_ rather than asking the informant to imagine speaking to a subject at different distances _comma_ I controlled the volume by having the informant wear headphones and played white noise from a detuned radio .
1713,4,A collaborative agent does not insist on winning an argument _comma_ and may change his beliefs if another agent presents convincing justification for an opposing belief .
1714,7,We describe in this section criteria for selecting the tagset .
1715,3,It follows that if Baum-Welch re-estimation is to be an effective technique _comma_ the initial data must have either biasing in the transitions ( the T0 cases ) or in the lexical probabilities ( cases D0+T1 and D1+T1 ) _comma_ but it is not necessary to have both ( D2 / D3 + T0 and D0 / D1+T1 ) .
1716,3,The remaining task is that of assigning scores to equivalence relations .
1717,4,This bears directly on the problems of brittleness and complexity that discrete approaches to language processing share with _comma_ for example _comma_ reasoning systems based on traditional logical inference .
1718,3,For instance _comma_ distinguishing between different types of fiction by formal or stylistic criteria of this kind may just be something we should not attempt : the fiction types are naturally defined in terms of their content _comma_ after all .
1719,3,The transfer module is free to attempt structural transfer in order to produce the best possible first guess .
1720,3,By using these predicates _comma_ partial but possibly useful information can be extracted from a sentence despite a global failure to parse it ( see section  ) .
1721,3,The third run was conducted with skipping enabled _comma_ and with a simple heuristic that prefers parses based only on the number of words skipped .
1722,7,While in subsection  an statistical measure to fulfill stage is presented _comma_ stages and are discussed in thoroughly .
1723,3,Lexical items such as cue words influence the value of the RHET_RELN type ( See Figure  ) .
1724,4,Conversational partners not only respond to what others say _comma_ but feel free to volunteer information that is not requested and sometimes ask questions of their own Nickerson 1976 .
1725,3,This tool is now a switch of Jacques Vergne 's multilingual syntactic parser ( for french _comma_ english and spanish ) .
1726,3,In order to illustrate how ordinary parsers can be used to compute the intersection of a FSA and a CFG consider first the definite-clause specification of a top-down parser .
1727,3,Furthermore _comma_ we have transferred them from their context in the Meaning-Text Theory to a different theoretical setting .
1728,3,Assuming that we now have a corpus parsed with the state-transition grammar _comma_ how can this information be used to parse fresh text .
1729,7,Finally _comma_ in section  we discuss the performance achieved _comma_ and suggest further refinements of the technique in order to solve some remaining problems .
1730,3,This assumption exsists because Japanese is a head-final language _comma_ a modifier is on the left of its modifiee .
1731,4,There is also recent evidence suggesting that _comma_ during speech processing _comma_ partial interpretations can be built extremely rapidly _comma_ even before words are completed Spivey-Knowlton et al. 1994 .
1732,4,The role of these components is to assign two interrelated structures to any linguistic entity licensed by the grammar : a tree ( the c-structure ) and a feature structure ( the f-structure ) .
1733,5,This approach parallels the treatment of pronoun resolution espoused by Hobbs 1979 _comma_ in which pronouns are modeled as free variables that are bound as a by-product of coherence resolution .
1734,3,Cooperative processing deals with errors that one backtracks to catch ; if not a different class or range _comma_ these at least might have a different distribution of error types .
1735,3,The general pattern of the results presented does not vary greatly with the corpus and tagset used .
1736,4,The temporal relations that hold between events described by successive utterances are often left implicit or underspecified .
1737,4,In cases where such conflicts are relevant to the task at hand _comma_ the agents should engage in collaborative negotiation as an attempt to square away the discrepancies in their beliefs .
1738,5,For smoothing a particular n-gram model _comma_ we took a linear combination of all lower order n-gram models .
1739,5,One strategy that supports deliberation is the Explicit-Warrant strategy _comma_ as in  .
1740,3,It uses a wide-coverage noun taxonomy and a statistical measure to generalize the appropriate semantic classes .
1741,3,It isn't until after the addressee 's next action that an assumption can have its strength modified .
1742,4,Textual errors since documents coming from different electronic ways may contain spelling and grammatical errors as well as character recognition errors generated by OCR .
1743,3,p may not cohere with B 's beliefs _comma_
1744,3,B may believe that p does not contribute to the common goal _comma_
1745,5,The effect is to treat Fred a book as a verb phrase missing its verb .
1746,3,When the anaphor occurs before a given preposition in the sentence _comma_ its resolution does not depend on where the preposition is to be attached ( except for cataphors that are quite rare ) .
1747,3,For the slot-based model _comma_ sometimes case slots are found to be dependent .
1748,5,Gerdemann and Goetz 's Troll system Goetz 1993 _comma_ Gerdemann and King 1994 _comma_ Gerdemann forthcoming employs an efficient refinement of to test the satisfiability of feature structures .
1749,5,All parameters are initialized randomly .
1750,3,In this case _comma_ the mapping of the semantic role ` agent ' to the syntactic function ` subject ' is revised .
1751,3,Keeping track of the fact that the tokens were initially agglutinated reduces the overall ambiguity .
1752,3,This topic bears on an important general issue : how are the ` dynamic ' ( or ` generative ' _comma_ or ` procedural ' ) aspects of grammar to be reconciled with the ` static ' _comma_ ( or ` declarative ' ) model theoretic world view .
1753,3,Whereas at present each rule is compiled individually _comma_ it would be preferable to enhance preprocessing in order to compute certain kinds of global information from the grammar .
1754,3,Narrative progression is dealt with by using the feature Rpt ( or reference point ) .
1755,5,Due to the exclusion of phrases with 'empty ' semantics ( which would be trivial substructures of the input semantics ) _comma_ the method always terminates .
1756,5,For example _comma_ Combinatory Categorial Grammar ( CCG ) Steedman 1990 is a theory of syntax and semantic interpretation that has the attractive characteristic of handling many coordination constructs that other theories cannot .
1757,3,Abstract generation is realized as a suitable application of the extracted rhetorical structure .
1758,3,A more controversial question concerns rhetorical relations and the extent to which these are detected and used by listeners Grosz and Sidner 1986 .
1759,3,Default handling can be easily adapted to the requirements of multilingual generation by using language-specific default-descriptions .
1760,3,For all knowledge sources the question arises how knowledge can be shared .
1761,3,We use  to specify schemata annotated rules and the LFG uniqueness _comma_ completeness and coherence principles .
1762,2,The cascading guesser performed better than Brill 's original guesser by about 8 % boosting the performance on the unknown words from 84.5 % to 92.2 % .
1763,3,This says that only holds between a description of the type of event C where somebody B borrows something A _comma_ and an abstraction over situations in which I did something to some car .
1764,3,First _comma_ we are planning to apply the algorithm to an as yet untagged language .
1765,4,Only examples  are constituent coordinations .
1766,2,However _comma_ if we use that method we will end up ( typically ) with an enormously large forest grammar that is not even guaranteed to contain solutions .
1767,4,An illustration of such a learning is shown in Figure  _comma_ where the system _comma_ departing from the three examples of use _comma_ and knowing that prosecutor _comma_ buyer and lawmaker are nouns belonging to the semantic class _comma_ and that indictment _comma_ assurance and legislation are members of _comma_ should induce that the verb seek imposes SRs that constraint the subject to be a member of the semantic type _comma_ and the object to be a kind of .
1768,5,This has a small number of possible semantic representations ( the exact number depending upon the grammar ) e.g.
1769,4,The semantic contribution of each lexical entry _comma_ which we will refer to as a meaning constructor _comma_ is a linear-logic formula consisting of instructions in the glue language for combining the meanings of the lexical entry 's syntactic arguments to obtain the meaning of the f-structure headed by the entry .
1770,3,2100 of the verified parse trees constituted the training set _comma_ while 230 of them were used for the test set .
1771,3,However _comma_ I insert morphs between feature structures and objects to yield an interpretation free characterisation of a satisfiable feature structure .
1772,3,This can be done _comma_ and the method which we adopt has the merit of simplicity .
1773,4,Thus _comma_ there is a trade-off relationship between the simplicity of clustering ( a model ) and the goodness of fit to the data .
1774,3,These are :
1775,3,On backtracking it returns the set with the next highest threshold value .
1776,3,We now turn to the question of what strategy ( or criterion ) we should employ for estimating the best model .
1777,3,What we obtain is the single rule of State-Application _comma_ which corresponds to application when the list of arguments _comma_ R  _comma_ is empty _comma_ to function composition when R is of length one _comma_ and to n-ary composition when R is of length n .
1778,1,We have thus developed an evaluation heuristic that combines several different measures _comma_ in order to select the parse that is deemed overall `` best '' .
1779,3,The quantitative model is in a much better position to cope with these problems .
1780,2,However _comma_ there are problems with having just composition _comma_ the most basic of the non-applicative operations .
1781,3,Most of the discussion in Kaplan and Bresnan 1982 is conducted in such terms .
1782,3,So _comma_ in our sense _comma_ a suggestion is an illocutionary act of questioning ; along with actually suggesting a way to expand a plan _comma_ the agent is asking whether or not the referent has the suggested attribute .
1783,5,Generation finally succeeds if the root node of the current syntax tree is labeled with the start symbol of the grammar and the root of the semantic analysis tree with the input semantics .
1784,3,We obtained quite stable results in these experiments .
1785,7,In the following section _comma_ we shall present a formal language for talking about this representation ; that is _comma_ a language for specifying LFG grammars .
1786,3,`` # n '' _comma_ the number of nouns appearing in the corpus that are contained in the class .
1787,5,We associate probabilities with partial phrase markers _comma_ which are sets of terminal and non-terminal nodes generated by beginning from the starting node successively expanding non-terminal leaves of the partial tree .
1788,4,The two variables that determine a parser 's computational complexity are the grammar and the input string Barton et al. 1987 .
1789,3,The results for utterances involving HH and LL sequences are displayed in Figure  _comma_ while results for L H and HL are displayed in Figure .
1790,3,First _comma_ many interruptions in the TODs result from the apprentice seizing control just to indicate that there is a temporary problem and that plan execution should be delayed .
1791,3,In the worst case _comma_ we can imagine picking an arbitrary child TNCB ( O(n) ) and then trying to find another one with which it combines ( O(n) ) .
1792,3,Firstly _comma_ we note that the model theoretic approach can almost certainly be extended to cover constraining equations .
1793,3,In the other evaluation experiment we measured the performance of the guessing rules against the training corpus .
1794,1,This paper has two objectives :
1795,3,requires a theory of mutual belief that supports mutual beliefs of various strengths ;
1796,3,The former figure looks more impressive _comma_ but the latter gives a better measure of how well the tagger is doing _comma_ since it factors out the trivial assignment of tags to non-ambiguous words .
1797,3,Consider the TNCBs in figure  .
1798,5,As Kehler 1994a points out _comma_ if forward movement of time is considered a default with consecutive event sentences _comma_ then the use of `` because '' in should cause a temporal clash -- whereas it is perfectly felicitous .
1799,3,on their own .
1800,3,For non-unit clauses _comma_ where the preference formula may contain uninstantiated variables _comma_ the priority is the value of the formula with the free variables instantiated to the highest possible preference value ( in case of an interpretation as probabilities : 1 ) _comma_ so that the priority is equal to the maximal possible preference value for the clause .
1801,3,The resulting grammar has 458 rules _comma_ which translate into a parsing table of almost 700 states .
1802,3,Text is automatically tagged using the first modules of the CLAWS program ( 1985 version ) _comma_ in which words are allocated one or more tags from 134 classes Garside 1987 .
1803,2,For example _comma_ the height of a tall building would normally be salient _comma_ but not if it were surrounded by other tall buildings .
1804,3,First it requires a model of mutual beliefs that specifies how mutual beliefs are inferred and how some mutual beliefs can be as weak as mutual suppositions .
1805,3,This improvement on unseen bigrams corresponds to an overall test set perplexity improvement of 2.4 % ( from 237.4 to 231.7 ) .
1806,3,The guesser for words that are not in the lexicon is described in more detail .
1807,3,In  the third sentence continues the thread about losing the key ; in the third starts a new thread .
1808,3,Category assignment :
1809,3,Construct  as follows :
1810,3,In this case _comma_ the value of the feature f in  must be a _comma_ whereas _comma_ the feature g is not fixed .
1811,3,Here a sentence was expected _comma_ but what was encountered was a noun phrase _comma_ John .
1812,4,It seems a perfectly valid rule of conversation not to tell people what they already know .
1813,3,For each  _comma_ if is the equivalence class of the empty path under then the abstraction of under is
1814,3,Therefore _comma_ using the initial restrictions _comma_ in a sentence of 22 words or more ( counting punctuation marks as words ) there could be 100 alternative placements .
1815,3,The situation becomes more interesting when we allow for downdrift and downstep .
1816,2,We tested a TNCB-based generator in the SLEMaT MT system with the pathological cases described in Brew 1992 against Whitelock 's original generation algorithm _comma_ and have obtained speed improvements of several orders of magnitude .
1817,7,This concludes the discussion of F  scaling in Bamileke Dschang .
1818,3,These interpretations contain the pragmatic inferences that have not been cancelled by context or conversant 's knowledge _comma_ plans _comma_ or intentions .
1819,3,is the sum of weighted activity of the nodes referred in the j-th subrfrant of _comma_ defined as follows :
1820,3,We put no boundaries upon the time when such a cancellation can occur _comma_ and we offer a unified explanation for pragmatic inferences that are inferable when simple utterances _comma_ complex utterances _comma_ or sequences of utterances are considered .
1821,3,We would expect these dialogues to differ in terms of initiative .
1822,3,Whereas the segmentation point data are inconclusive _comma_ word type data demonstrate that combining information sources is more useful than using distributional information alone .
1823,3,The model captures features specific to collaborative negotiation .
1824,5,In contrast _comma_ constraining equations are intended to constrain the value of an already existing feature-value pair .
1825,4,In order to illustrate these role changes _comma_ we show the alternation of the agent of the main verb in Table  with a short tip to Japanese lexicon .
1826,5,An alternative _comma_ suggested by Morrill 1990 and similar to Jorgensen and Abeille 1992 _comma_ is to use the following coordination schema :
1827,3,To measure the Assoc by means of Mutual Information between the pair v-s and c .
1828,3,Three features of the system are basically used for repair : First _comma_ input increments are uniquely associated with objects of VM-GEN _comma_ so that input modifications can be translated into modifications of the objects ' states .
1829,3,These appear to be longer-term research goals _comma_ however .
1830,5,The ability to deal with functions of functions has advantages in enabling more elegant linguistic descriptions _comma_ and in providing one kind of robust parsing : the parser never fails until the last word _comma_ since there could always be a final word which is a function over all the constituents formed so far .
1831,3,M is a semi-morph iff [ M is a triple  _comma_
1832,2,This will not be predicted by the unselective binding of quantifiers in DRT _comma_ which quantify over all the free variables in their scope _comma_ in this case women-cat pairs .
1833,3,This work is supported by a British Telecom Scholarship _comma_ administered by the Cambridge Commonwealth Trust in conjunction with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office .
1834,7,Later on _comma_ default handling is included and exemplified for two general cases .
1835,3,If this information is not to be lost _comma_ some way of referring to the structure of the compositions _comma_ as well as to their results _comma_ seems to be required .
1836,5,Furthermore _comma_ certain techniques for robust parsing can be modelled as finite state transducers .
1837,1,Then we address the problem of combining these basic semantics in order to formally and automatically derive the spatiotemporal semantics of a motion complex from the spatiotemporal properties of its components .
1838,3,For example _comma_ the following production requires that the x and y subtrees of the mother 's tree are shared with the B and C daughters _comma_ respectively .
1839,3,We would like to extend the system by using a more detailed transcription system .
1840,3,For a start _comma_ not all models are created equal .
1841,5,However _comma_ now consider processing the rabbit in none of the boxes .
1842,3,30 editorial articles of Asahi Shinbun _comma_ a Japanese newspaper _comma_ and 42 technical papers of Toshiba Review _comma_ a journal of Toshiba Corp .
1843,5,MDL stipulates that the best probability model for given data is that model which requires the least code length for encoding of the model itself _comma_ as well as the given data relative to it .
1844,1,Here _comma_ however _comma_ I make the assumption that word groupings have been obtained through some black box procedure _comma_ e.g. from analysis of unannotated text _comma_ and the goal is to annotate the words within the groupings post hoc using a knowledge-based catalogue of senses .
1845,5,This method depends on an independence assumption on the cooccurrence of  and : the more frequent is _comma_ the higher will be the estimate of _comma_ regardless of .
1846,3,We see three possible responses .
1847,3,For this _comma_ we should write down the constraints about these relations among semantic / pragmatic roles in a feature structure formalism .
1848,7,A method to draw the co-occurrence triples from corpus is proposed in subsection  .
1849,3,PLIG are more powerful than LIG since they can generate the k-copy language for any fixed k ( see Example  ) .
1850,2,Top-down algorithms are not well suited for processing grammatical theories like Categorial Grammar or HPSG that would only allow very general predictions because they make use of general schemata instead of construction-specific rules .
1851,3,Some domains and tasks lend themselves more obviously to a clustering approach than others .
1852,3,The performance results were encouraging and demonstrate the promise of automated tone transcription .
1853,3,In the following scheme _comma_ the desired coverage of the specialized grammar is prescribed _comma_ and the parse trees are cut up at appropriate places without having to specify the tree-cutting criteria manually :
1854,3,Each CCG LF is represented as an untyped  - term _comma_ namely type tm. abs represents object-level abstraction by the meta-level expression ( abs N ) _comma_ where N is a meta-level function of type .
1855,5,It was first applied to linguistic description by Adjukiewicz and Bar-Hillel in the 1950s .
1856,7,Subsection  presents error checking .
1857,2,Third _comma_ unlike conventional knowledge or script-based abstract generation systems Lehnert 1980 _comma_ Fum 1986 _comma_ the rhetorical structure extraction does not need prepared knowledge or scripts related to the original text _comma_ and can be used for texts of any domain _comma_ so long as they contain enough rhetorical expressions to be expository writings .
1858,7,This section gives a mathematical basis for a general approach to F  scaling which _comma_ it is hoped _comma_ will be applicable to any tone language .
1859,3,Medial ( like through )
1860,1,We present a polynomial time algorithm for lexicalist MT generation provided that sufficient information can be transferred to ensure more determinism .
1861,7,Section  explains how to measure the similarity by spreading activation on the semantic network .
1862,3,This strategy predicts the readings generated for the examples in Section  .
1863,3,Now _comma_ it is certainly possible to talk about models using natural language ( as readers of this paper will already be aware ) and for many purposes ( such as discussion with other linguists ) natural language is undoubtedly the best medium .
1864,3,For example _comma_ Test  `` if a NP is modified by ` aimed at _comma_ for ... ' then it is ` generic '' ' is applied as part of translating NP 1-muke into `` for NP 1 '' .
1865,7,I will attempt to argue that the important distinction is not so much a rational-empirical or symbolic-statistical distinction but rather a qualitative-quantitative one .
1866,5,By using the proper branch method of axiomatising the grammar _comma_ the structure building section of the parser is only constrained in that it must produce proper branches ; it is therefore possible to experiment with different interpreters ( i.e. structure proposing engines ) while keeping the grammar constant .
1867,3,More recent versions of these systems have been gradually taking on a more quantitative flavor _comma_ particularly with respect to choosing between alternative analyses _comma_ but our hypothetical system will be more purist in its qualitative approach .
1868,5,Indeed _comma_ Grice 's QUANTITY maxim has often been interpreted this way : Do not make your contribution more informative than is required Grice 1967 .
1869,3,They denote a change of the relations between the parts of an entity .
1870,3,Sentence analysis accomplishes morphological and syntactic analysis for each sentence .
1871,3,Definition 11 .
1872,5,Brill et al. 1990 recognised this _comma_ and introduced the idea of distituents .
1873,3,In spite of Chall 's warnings about injudicious application to writing tasks _comma_ readability measurement has naively come to be used as a prescriptive metric of good writing as a tool for writers _comma_ and has thus come into some disrepute among text researchers .
1874,3,The output is a new logical form representing the context as a whole _comma_ with all variables correctly bound .
1875,5,which is  - equivalent to .
1876,3,In future research _comma_ we intend to deal with syntagmatic relations between words .
1877,1,We show that the parsing problem for semidirectional Lambek Grammar is NP-complete by a reduction of the 3-Partition problem .
1878,6,Definite NPs and other presuppositional constructions place constraints on the discourse _comma_ so that a sentence containing the phrase the man will be uninterpretable in contexts not containing a unique man ( a version of this point has been made by _comma_ among others _comma_ Barwise and Perry 1983 _comma_ Kamp 1984 _comma_ Groenendijk and Stokhof 1987 ) .
1879,3,Finally _comma_ consider the counterpart of the completeness principle _comma_ the coherence principle .
1880,2,However _comma_ unlike Bar-Hillel _comma_ we allow one argument to be absorbed at a time .
1881,2,Note that the construction of Bar-Hillel would have yielded a grammar with 88 rules .
1882,3,the external zone of contact ;
1883,3,The corresponding schema of such a proof tree is shown in Figure  .
1884,3,Secondly _comma_ we introduce an additional term in the head of introduction rules to signal the fact that when we apply a particular introduction relationship to a node we also specialize the type of the node by picking exactly one of the direct subtypes of its current type .
1885,3,Categories that can be induced well ( those characterized by local dependencies ) could be input into procedures that learn phrase structure Brill and Marcus 1992b _comma_ Finch 1993 .
1886,3,The latter case arises when the grammar simply does not account for some terminal .
1887,5,For example _comma_ in Dynamic Predicate Logic Groenendijk and Stokhof 1991 _comma_ states are threaded from the antecedent of a conditional into the consequent _comma_ and from a restrictor of a quantifier into the body .
1888,3,Most of the steps are justified by the application of a definition or a theorem _comma_ the rest are justified by inference rules of the natural deduction ( ND ) calculus _comma_ such as the `` Case '' rule .
1889,5,Comparing all possible pairs of sites is a O (  ) problem _comma_ whereas considering all possible two-way partitions of the dialect area is O ( 2 ) .
1890,2,So we do not adopt the model suggested by Shoham and Tennenholtz 1992 in which agents ' behavior cannot violate the defined social laws .
1891,5,The elements of the imagery system _comma_ called `` imagens '' _comma_ are connected to the logogens in the verbal systems via referential connections .
1892,3,In our approach _comma_ guessing rules are extracted from the lexicon and the actual corpus frequencies of word-usage then allow for discrimination between rules which are no longer productive ( but have left their imprint on the basic lexicon ) and rules that are productive in real-life texts .
1893,3,Whereas anaphoric forms in the semantics for these forms are independently resolved _comma_ empty syntactic constituents in and of themselves are not anaphoric _comma_ and thus may only be restored when some independently-motivated process necessitates it .
1894,3,The table below summarizes the results for some grammars of different coverage extracted using :
1895,3,There were two types of data in use at this stage .
1896,6,The concurrent calculus is modeled with Chemical Abstract Machine .
1897,3,If the listener believes a fact P and believes that fact to be relevant and either believes that the speaker believes not P or that the speaker does not know P then interrupt ;
1898,4,Reiteration of words is easy to capture by morphological analysis .
1899,3,Ambiguous words must be represented as having different hyperonym classes .
1900,5,This `` core parser '' has been the subject of a number of computational implementations _comma_ including Marcus 1980 's deterministic parser _comma_ Description theory ( henceforth _comma_ D-theory ) Marcus et al. 1983 _comma_ and Abney 's licensing based model Abney 1987 _comma_ Abney 1989 .
1901,7,We expand on these points and introduce other differences below .
1902,5,the normalization factor required to ensure  is
1903,3,Tensed auxiliaries in complex tenses are anaphoric _comma_ identifying  as a previously existing temporal entity .
1904,4,Gapping is characterized by an antecedent sentence ( henceforth called the source sentence ) and the elision of all but two constituents ( and in limited circumstances _comma_ more than two constituents ) in one or more subsequent target sentences _comma_ as exemplified in sentence  :
1905,4,( This problem is usually referred to as the ` data sparseness problem ' . )
1906,3,The coverage of R is then m .
1907,5,The works of Pruest 1992 and Asher 1993 provide analyses of VP-ellipsis in the context of an account of discourse structure and coherence .
1908,3,This is especially true when it comes to modelling the effects of linguistic actions .
1909,2,Here we compared two discourse strategies : All-Implicit and Explicit-Warrant .
1910,3,The individual tags are converted to a bipos and tripos representation .
1911,3,Since different verb senses occur in the corpus _comma_ the SRs acquired appear mixed .
1912,3,Cut up the training examples by matching them against the and-or tree and cutting at the determined cutnodes .
1913,5,Semantic composition is performed by the coindexing of the features dref _comma_ res _comma_ subj _comma_ etc .
1914,3,Definition 6 .
1915,3,The accuracy of the taggers on the set of 347 unknown words when they were made known to the lexicon was detected at 98.5 % for both taggers .
1916,6,The method combines a constraint-based approach with an approach based on preferences : we exploit the HPSG type hierarchy and unification to arrive at a temporal structure using constraints placed on that structure by tense _comma_ aspect _comma_ rhetorical structure and temporal expressions _comma_ and we use the temporal centering preferences described by Kameyama et al. 1993 _comma_ Poesio 1994 to rate the possibilities for temporal structure and choose the best among them .
1917,3,Designing effective dialogue systems requires designing agents that can choose among discourse strategies .
1918,5,As is evident in constraint  _comma_ ranking of the items on the forward center list _comma_ Cf _comma_ is crucial .
1919,3,Our short term goal is to propose an automatic method that can learn parameter values of heuristics by analyzing the corpus .
1920,3,This work was supported in part by National Science Foundation Grant IRI - 9009018 _comma_ National Science Foundation Grant IRI - 9350192 _comma_ and a grant from the Xerox Corporation .
1921,3,the plan contains a description that is useful for making an identification plan that the hearer can execute to identify the referent _comma_ and
1922,6,( See e.g. Cover and Thomas 1991 _comma_ chapter 2 for the reasoning behind this ) .
1923,5,However _comma_ threading from left-to-right disallows examples of optional cataphora _comma_ as in example  _comma_ and examples of compulsory cataphora as in :
1924,2,Kehler 1993a has convincingly argued that this problem arises because Dalrymple et al. do not distinguish between merely co-referential and co-indexed ( in his terminology _comma_ role-linked ) expressions .
1925,5,For the Inside-Outside algorithm _comma_ we follow the methodology described by Lari and Young .
1926,3,We have extended the Penn and Carpenter implementation of the HPSG grammar so that semantic aspect is calculated compositionally ( and stored here ) .
1927,3,The probabilistic models give us a systematic and well motivated way of ranking alternative hypotheses .
1928,3,It can be applied to computing the similarity between texts _comma_ and measuring the cohesiveness of a text which suggests coherence of the text _comma_ as we have seen in Section  .
1929,3,Only a rule defined this way can be invoked as an ignore rule in an RHS clause .
1930,7,This section describes procedures to acquire collocational information for analyzing compound nouns from a corpus of four kanzi character words .
1931,3,You cannot buy an I R A .
1932,3,Following Laur 1993 _comma_ we consider simple prepositions ( like in ) as well as prepositional phrases ( like in front of ) .
1933,5,Recently various methods for automatically constructing a thesaurus ( hierarchically clustering words ) based on corpus data have been proposed Hindle 1990 _comma_ Brown et al. 1992 _comma_ Pereira et al. 1993 _comma_ Tokunaga et al. 1995 .
1934,1,This paper describes recent work on developing an integrated heuristic scheme for selecting the parse that is deemed `` best '' from such a collection .
1935,5,Convergence of the model is improved by keeping the number of parameters in the model down .
1936,3,Furthermore _comma_ the string and its components must be self-delimiting _comma_ so that a decoder could identify the endpoints of components by itself .
1937,3,I is an interpretation  _comma_
1938,3,The fragmentation feature was given a weight of 1.1 _comma_ to prefer skipping a word if it reduces the fragmentation count by at least one .
1939,3,for some effective function  _comma_ [ for each and each _comma_ [ if then ` true ' otherwise ` false ' _comma_ and
1940,4,Parsing a natural language sentence can be viewed as making a sequence of disambiguation decisions : determining the part-of-speech of the words _comma_ choosing between possible constituent structures _comma_ and selecting labels for the constituents .
1941,3,We were led to seek a solution for this problem within DRT _comma_ because of DRT 's advantages as a general theory of discourse _comma_ and its choice as the underlying formalism in another research project of ours _comma_ which deals with sentences such as  - _comma_ in the context of natural language specifications of computerized systems .
1942,3,When plans are perceived as succeeding _comma_ participants use explicit cues such as prompts _comma_ repetitions and summaries to signal their readiness to move to the next stage of the plan .
1943,3,After sentences of each paragraph are reduced _comma_ inter-paragraph structure reduction is carried out in the same way based on the relative importance judgement on the inter-paragraph rhetorical structure .
1944,3,In the table _comma_ the confidence value of using architectural style to describe a building is 4 .
1945,3,It combines the advantages of Prolog-interpreted DCGs ( ease of modification _comma_ parser output suitable for direct use by other programs _comma_ etc. ) with the ability to relax the adjacency constraints of that formalism in a flexible and dynamic manner .
1946,5,It allows bottom-up filtering that achieves a goal-directedness which corresponds to dynamic top-down evaluation with abstraction and subsumption checking .
1947,2,Thus _comma_ the noun very old dilapidated car can get the unacceptable bracketing _comma_ [ [ very [ old dilapidated ] ] car ] .
1948,3,These differences can be explained in terms of collaborative planning principles .
1949,3,From the observations in the previous section _comma_ we propose the following guidelines for how to train a HMM for use in tagging :
1950,3,We thank Mr. K. Nakamura _comma_ Mr. T. Fujita _comma_ and Dr. K. Kobayashi of NEC C & C Res. Labs. for their constant encouragement .
1951,3,The response to a suggestion depends _comma_ obviously _comma_ on whether or not the suggestion was used to expand the plan .
1952,5,However _comma_ this is not allowed by Update Semantics which is eliminative : each new piece of information can only further refine the set of worlds .
1953,3,For example _comma_ the sentence `` Mary gave every dog a bone and some policeman a flower '' results in the LF :
1954,3,is the likelihood of an utterance arising from cluster ( or subpopulation ) _comma_ and is the likelihood assigned to word by cluster k _comma_ i.e. its relative frequency in that cluster .
1955,3,We call noun phrases used to make general statements about a class generic ; for example Mammoths are extinct .
1956,4,LFG assumes two syntactic levels of representation : constituent structure ( c-structure ) encodes phrasal dominance and precedence relations _comma_ and functional structure ( f-structure ) encodes syntactic predicate-argument structure .
1957,3,We assume a simple greedy search strategy .
1958,3,Since the performance of both Hobbs and Brennan et al. varies according to the type of the text _comma_ and in fact was significantly worse on the task dialogues than on the texts _comma_ we might question how their performance would vary on other inputs .
1959,3,An action is obligatory if its occurrence logically follows from R _comma_ and forbidden if its non-occurrence logically follows from R .
1960,3,We maintain this property throughout the search process _comma_ that is _comma_ for every symbol A ' that we add to the grammar _comma_ we also add a rule  .
1961,5,Dialogues between a human and an ATIS database access system are therefore likely to be less clearly structured than in the Autoroute case .
1962,3,The remaining 20.8 % triples didn't belong to any of the classes induced for their syntactic positions .
1963,3,If the text is written loosely _comma_ the rhetorical structure generally contains many BothNucleus relations ( e.g. _comma_ parallel ( mata ( and _comma_ also ) ) _comma_ and the system cannot gradate the penalties and cannot reduce sentences smoothly .
1964,4,It seems then that adjectives which are not literal translations of one another may share meaning properties specifically in the collocational context .
1965,3,A useful side-effect of this is that we can preserve the invariant that all types except those at the fringe of the structure are maximal .
1966,2,We will outline here the main parallels and differences between our method and cooccurrence smoothing .
1967,3,Calculate the entropy of each or-node .
1968,4,For example _comma_ if a joint distribution  over 3 random variables can be written ( approximated ) as follows _comma_ it ( approximately ) satisfies such an assumption .
1969,3,If the s rule in the running example is not optimized _comma_ the resulting processing behavior would not have fallen out so nicely :
1970,3,First _comma_ we consider the past perfect _comma_ as in sentence  .
1971,3,We intend to use core knowledge sources for representing common phenomena .
1972,3,Let  be .
1973,3,For our simple unigram language model without clustering _comma_ the training corpus perplexity is minimized ( and its likelihood is maximized ) by assigning each word  a probability _comma_ where is the frequency of and N is the total size of the corpus .
1974,3,The project has tried to investigate the use of lexical functions as an interlingual device _comma_ i.e. _comma_ one which is shared by the semantic representations of collocations in the language pairs .
1975,3,As Japanese does not distinguish between the two the system must make the best choice it can _comma_ in the same way a human translator would have to .
1976,3,Arc scores in those lattices are sums of an acoustic score ( negative log likelihood ) and a language-model score _comma_ in this case the negative log probability provided by the baseline bigram model .
1977,3,As we have come to these distinctions by examining different linguistic material _comma_ we conclude that language structures space in the same way whatever sort of lexical items ( motion verbs ( dynamic ) / ( static ) spatial prepositions ) we examine .
1978,3,for some effective function  _comma_ [ for each and each _comma_ [ if is defined then otherwise ` undefined '
1979,3,The algorithm has been implemented in an HPSG natural language system which serves as the interface to a database query application .
1980,2,Problems with the latter requirement were pointed out by Sag et al. 1985 _comma_ who gave the following counterexamples :
1981,3,Thus _comma_ if walked ' has type  _comma_ then is a -Prolog ( meta-level ) function with type _comma_ and is the object-level representation _comma_ with type tm .
1982,3,The anaphoric pronouns have to be resolved first _comma_ so as to determine what semantic class they refer to ; the PP attachment procedure can then be applied .
1983,3,Universally quantified NPs say that all items of the specified type satisfy some property .
1984,5,The method can be easily exported to other configurations .
1985,2,It is not clear that these results scale up to reflect accurately the behaviour of parsers using realistic _comma_ complex unification-based grammars : in particular _comma_ with grammars admitting less ambiguity parse time will tend to increase more slowly with increasing input length _comma_ and also with smaller grammars rule application can be constrained tightly with relatively simple predictive techniques .
1986,3,Future research will be aimed at determining _comma_ firstly _comma_ how we can enrich the information to which the search strategy is sensitive in order to provide a better match with human preferences _comma_ and secondly _comma_ which constraints should be relaxed in order to avoid the problem of undergeneration .
1987,1,In particular _comma_ we show how discourse obligations can be used to account in a natural manner for the connection between a question and its answer in dialogue and how obligations can be used along with other parts of the discourse context to extend the coverage of a dialogue system .
1988,3,However _comma_ they may well be constituents in other grammars .
1989,6,Our work is related to research by Heid and Raab 1989 .
1990,3,F is a feature structure  _comma_ and
1991,3,The results of this tagging are summarised in Table  .
1992,1,We address the role of two phenomena with respect to the recovery of these relations :
1993,3,This provides some hope that an inflectional analysis might should help considerably with unknown words .
1994,4,However _comma_ semantically inappropriate or nonsensical ` antecedents ' are also possible when we consider non-constituent coordination .
1995,3,The right-context neighbors all take `` to '' - infinitives as complements .
1996,3,However _comma_ this is not a problem _comma_ since our analysis of the perfect by the use of the operator perf _comma_ analyses the eventuality referred to by the main clause _comma_ as the result state of a previous event .
1997,4,This is because in Japanese _comma_ noun phrases are not normally marked with respect to number .
1998,5,Sguy 1973 _comma_ Philps 1987 _comma_ and Durand 1989 use some combination of lexical _comma_ phonological _comma_ and morphological data .
1999,4,This success was directly measurable in terms of word recognition error rates _comma_ prompting language processing researchers to seek corresponding improvements in performance and robustness .
2000,3,Secondly _comma_ it can highlight anomalous aspects of a given system .
2001,5,In Wood 's SYSCONJ system _comma_ the parser can back up to various points in the history of the parse _comma_ and parse the second conjunct according to the configuration found .
2002,3,In this context _comma_ highly efficient word analysis and generation at run-time are less important than ensuring that the morphology mechanism is expressive _comma_ is easy to debug _comma_ and allows relatively quick compilation .
2003,6,Following the analysis given in Dalrymple et al. 1994b _comma_ the lexical entry for want takes a quantified NP as an argument .
2004,1,This classification method is based on texts observation and understanding of their natural properties .
2005,5,To assist in this _comma_ low frequency items in the lexicon are grouped together into equivalence classes _comma_ such that all words in a given equivalence class have the same tags and lexical probabilities _comma_ and whenever one of the words is looked up _comma_ then the data common to all of them is used .
2006,2,This constraint rules out cases where VP-ellipsis obtains syntactically mismatched antecedents _comma_ such as example  and other non-parallel cases given in Kehler 1993b .
2007,5,Specifically _comma_ to account for the forward progression of time induced by successive simple past tenses in a narrative _comma_ they treat the simple past as referring to a time evoked by a previous past tense .
2008,3,For example _comma_ as we shall later see _comma_ there seems to be no reasonable way to deal with LFG 's  definitions using the simple models of the present paper .
2009,4,Underspecifications can be caused by shortcomings of the component providing the input or by the preliminary state of incrementally given input .
2010,5,A discourse segment consists of a sequence of utterances  .
2011,3,Other evidence may be combined with the similarity-based estimate .
2012,4,evaluate and improve on a current system _comma_
2013,2,Obviously _comma_ an agent cannot use this criterion to understand the reference to the building in Example  -- he has never heard of the building before .
2014,3,In each case _comma_ we use 4500 sentences for training _comma_ with 500 of these sentences held out for smoothing .
2015,3,They also believe that the advisee must contribute both the problem description and also constraints as to how the problem can be solved .
2016,3,In two of the patterns _comma_ the re-estimation ultimately reduces the accuracy of the tagging rather than improving it .
2017,3,In short _comma_ the second strategy is a ` divide and conquer ' strategy : treat structural issues using model theoretic tools _comma_ and procedural issues with ( revealing ) computational tools .
2018,5,In LIG derivations the application of a rule cannot depend on more than a bounded portion of the top of the stack .
2019,3,Consider _comma_ however _comma_ that instead of generating all the possible temporal / rhetorical structures _comma_ we could use the information available to fill in the most restrictive type possible in the type hierarchy of temporal / rhetorical relations shown in Figure  .
2020,2,` Consistency ' is another desirable property of MDL _comma_ which is not shared by MLE .
2021,3,Additional code is added to maintain a chart of known successes and failures of each rule .
2022,3,In all three runs _comma_ the single selected parse result for each sentence was manually evaluated to determine if the parser returned with a `` correct '' parse .
2023,3,In what follows _comma_ the event variable associated with  is and the TEMPFOC of is the most recent event / activity processed _comma_ possibly e itself :
2024,1,This paper falls directly between these approaches _comma_ using statistical information derived from corpora analysis to weight syntactic analyses produced by a ` principles and parameters ' parser .
2025,4,where both of zero subjects  and refer to the sentential topic Hanako .
2026,3,(A1) TRUTH :
2027,4,We assume that there is a one-to-one map from the nonterminal leaf nodes of the ( local ) syntax tree on the leaf nodes of the ( local ) semantic derivation tree .
2028,3,Change of location ( CoL ) verbs ( entrer-to enter ; sortir-to go out ) denote a change of location .
2029,4,( A dendroid distribution can also be considered as a restricted form of the Bayesian network Pearl 1988 . )
2030,3,where  is the ( unnormalized ) weight given to _comma_ determined by its degree of similarity to .
2031,2,If significant human intervention is needed to provide the biasing _comma_ then the advantages of automatic training become rather weaker _comma_ especially if such intervention is needed on each new text domain .
2032,3,We conducted some experiments to test the performance of the proposed method as a method of acquiring case frame patterns .
2033,5,The same techniques that are used for calculating the intersection of a FSA and a CFG can be applied in the case of DCGs .
2034,3,How can the collaborative planning principles highlight the differences we observe ?
2035,3,General text types may be useful _comma_ but quite probably there will be a domain - or field-specific text typology .
2036,4,General-purpose natural language ( NL ) analysis systems have recently started to use declarative unification-based sentence grammar formalisms ; systems of this type include SRI 's CLARE system Alshawi et al. 1992 and the Alvey NL Tools ( ANLT ) Briscoe et al. 1987a .
2037,5,From a pre-tagged training corpus it constructs the suffix tree where every suffix is associated with its information measure .
2038,7,This will be discussed in the final section of the paper .
2039,4,Collocations have been studied by computational linguists in different contexts .
2040,6,The EBG scheme has previously proved most successful for tuning a natural-language grammar to a specific application domain and thereby achieve very much faster parsing _comma_ at the cost of a small reduction in coverage .
2041,5,Most of the informants were over seventy years old and had not spoken Irish since their youth .
2042,3,In order to find the correct string most of the outside candidates must be dropped _comma_
2043,4,Two sources of information that might aid speech segmentation are : distribution -- the phoneme sequence in cat appears frequently in several contexts including thecat _comma_ cats and catnap _comma_ whereas the sequence in catn is rare and appears in restricted contexts ; and phonotactics -- cat is an acceptable syllable in English _comma_ whereas pcat is not .
2044,3,Table  shows the nearest neighbors of two words ( ordered according to closeness to the head word ) after the dimensionality reduction .
2045,3,As well as this quantitative approach _comma_ we will consider a constraint / logic based approach and try to distinguish characteristics that we wish to preserve from those that are best replaced by statistical models .
2046,3,The interaction of morphological analysis with spelling correction Carter 1992 _comma_ Oflazer 1994 _comma_ Bowden 1995 is another possibly fruitful area of work .
2047,3,LHIP grammars are an extended form of Prolog DCG grammars .
2048,3,Then these constituents can be processed further .
2049,2,However _comma_ for some interesting cases _comma_ such as a Combinatory Categorial Grammar account of coordination constructs _comma_ this can only be done by obscuring the underlying linguistic theory with the `` tricks '' needed for implementation .
2050,3,It is currently in use for processing dialogue transcripts from the HCRC Map Task Corpus Anderson et al. 1991 _comma_ although we expect its eventual applications to be much wider .
2051,3,This necessitates an information exchange to resynchronize mutual beliefs _comma_ so that the rest of the plan may be successfully executed .
2052,3,These increments describe lexical items or semantic relations between them .
2053,3,It is important to note that this experiment does not claim to show how genres in fact differ .
2054,5,Previously _comma_ we assumed for simplicity that every link has a constant length .
2055,3,In other words _comma_ A may decide that it is easier to just say the warrant rather than require B to infer or retrieve it .
2056,3,Additionally _comma_ the first position can be assigned to the subject which can be uttered now .
2057,3,describes an event _comma_ or
2058,3,From a given solution ( set of triples )  we can compute in polynomial time a mapping k that sends the index of an element to the index of its solution triple _comma_ i.e. _comma_ .
2059,3,use another semantic information as well as thesauruses _comma_ such as selectional restriction
2060,4,Unfortunately _comma_ dialect definition can be a time-consuming and ill-defined process .
2061,4,Example  seems slightly unnatural _comma_ but it is much improved if we replace books by a heavier string such as books about gardening .
2062,6,In this paper _comma_ we propose such a solution _comma_ based on a careful distinction between different roles of Reichenbach 1947 's reference time _comma_ adapted from Kamp and Reyle 1993 .
2063,4,Many of the knowledge sources used for this purpose score a sentence hypothesis by calculating a simple _comma_ typically linear _comma_ combination of scores associated with objects _comma_ such as N-grams and grammar rules _comma_ that characterize the hypothesis or its preferred linguistic analysis .
2064,3,Patterns marked with * are morphologically plausible _comma_ but do not occur lexically with the cited nouns .
2065,3,Then we would have had  and .
2066,3,Note also that the use of the same bound variable names obj and sub causes no difficulty since the use of scoped-constants _comma_ meta-level  - reduction _comma_ and higher-order unification is used to access and manipulate the inner terms .
2067,5,Previous research has identified three means by which speakers signal information about discourse structure to listeners : Cue words and phrases Grosz and Sidner 1986 _comma_ Reichman 1985 ; Intonation Hirschberg and Pierrehumbert 1986 ; Pronominalisation Guidon et al. 1986 _comma_ Brennan et al. 1987 .
2068,3,Utterance  selects eighty one _comma_ with a narrow focus pitch accent .
2069,3,S to
2070,3,Data-Driven Processing :
2071,3,We then define a probabilistic model ( a joint distribution ) _comma_ written  _comma_ where random variable assumes a value from a fixed noun partition _comma_ and a value from a fixed verb partition .
2072,3,However repetitions _comma_ paraphrases and making inferences explicit also demonstrate complete hearing .
2073,4,Both anaphora resolution and prepositional phrase ( PP ) attachment are the most frequent ambiguities in natural language processing .
2074,4,Internal decisions are made on the basis of the specified input .
2075,3,Generally _comma_ obligation is defined in terms of a modal operator often called permissible .
2076,2,It also appears that neither approach can account for the infelicity of mixed gapping / VP-ellipsis cases such as sentence  .
2077,3,Broader issues raised by this work are noted and discussed .
2078,3,By repeated applications of  we can write down the following expression for :
2079,3,The error rates climb steeply with the number of categories tested for in the corpus we used .
2080,3,Second _comma_ once the rhetorical structure is obtained _comma_ various lengths of generated abstracts can be generated easily .
2081,5,Agents are logically omniscient .
2082,5,This allows peripheral extraction _comma_ where the ` gap ' is at the start or the end of e.g. a relative clause .
2083,4,For example _comma_ if determiners and nouns are marked for number _comma_ then the tagger can effectively model agreement in simple noun phrases _comma_ by having a higher probability for a singular determiner followed by a singular noun that it does for a singular determiner followed by a plural noun .
2084,5,The process continues recursively until all sites are grouped into one superdialect embracing the entire language area under consideration .
2085,5,That is _comma_ they add a feature value pair to any consistent f-structure .
2086,3,The system uses a robust island-based parsing method controlled by user-defined performance thresholds .
2087,5,This binary distinction has often been used to motivate a two-level architecture in the human syntactic processing system _comma_ where what we will call the `` core parser '' performs standard attachment _comma_ as well as being able to reanalyse in the easy cases ( such as on reaching hurts in  ) _comma_ but where the assistance of a higher level resolver ( to use Abney 's terminology Abney 1987 _comma_ Abney 1989 ) _comma_ is required to solve the difficult cases _comma_ ( such as on reaching melted in ) .
2088,5,Their model covers both the initiator of a referring action _comma_ and the recipient who tries to understand the reference .
2089,3,prepositions can be :
2090,3,Their approach is attractive _comma_ because it permits a computational treatment of dynamism that abstracts from low level algorithmic details .
2091,3,Present participles and gerunds are difficult because they exhibit both verbal and nominal properties and occur in a wide variety of different contexts whereas other parts of speech have a few typical and frequent contexts .
2092,3,This _comma_ actually gave us the search-space of four combinations : the Xerox tagger equipped with the original Xerox guesser _comma_ Brill 's tagger with its original guesser _comma_ the Xerox tagger with our cascading P + S + E guesser and Brill 's tagger with the cascading guesser .
2093,4,Segmentation of Japanese is difficult only when using syntactic knowledge .
2094,2,De Swart 's solution does overcome Partee 's quantification problem _comma_ although not within DRT .
2095,1,This paper presents a heuristic method that uses information in the Japanese text along with knowledge of English countability and number stored in transfer dictionaries to determine the countability and number of English noun phrases .
2096,5,In our experiments we used middle frequency words : the 51st to 1050th most frequent words in the reference Collins English Dictionary ( CED ) .
2097,4,Currently fully native use of Gaelic is limited to a few discontiguous areas in the westernmost reaches of Ireland and Scotland .
2098,2,In comparison with the Xerox word-ending guesser taken as the base-line model we detect a substantial increase in the precision by about 22 % and a cheerful increase in coverage by about 6 % .
2099,3,From this basic morphological transducer _comma_ we derived a new lexicon that matches the reduced tagset described above .
2100,3,They normally have the same number and countability as the noun phrase whose property they are describing .
2101,2,Unfortunately _comma_ the ability to perform abstraction of categories with functional types ( which is required for  ) also allows shared material to get different syntactic analyses _comma_ resulting in acceptance of all the sentences predicted by deletion accounts where identity of lexical categories and lexical semantics is respected _comma_ but not identity of syntactic structure .
2102,3,We consider lexical cohesion as semantic similarity between words .
2103,3,Such structures can straightforwardly be thought of as models _comma_ in the usual sense of first order model theory Hodges 1993 .
2104,5,From this starting point _comma_ the Inside-Outside algorithm is run until convergence .
2105,3,Firstly _comma_ it offers the prospect of meaningful comparison of linguistic frameworks .
2106,4,One choice a conversational agent must make is whether an utterance should include some relevant _comma_ but optional _comma_ information in what is communicated .
2107,3,Together with the investigation of several hitherto untried parameters _comma_ this is a next step .
2108,5,SYSCONJ does not immediately merge the two stack configurations after completing the second conjunct _comma_ but _comma_ instead _comma_ separately parses both conjuncts in parallel until a constituent is completed .
2109,3,The default body is expressed in terms of the missing input specification in order to make the system work homogeneously .
2110,4,While the former borrows from advanced linguistic specifications of syntax _comma_ the latter has been more concerned with extracting distributional regularities from language to aid the implementation of NLP systems and the analysis of corpora .
2111,3,The first column gives the relative frequenciy and the second column lists the tag chosen by the German HMM tagger .
2112,1,We will consider two in detail here : graphical interfaces _comma_ and dialogue .
2113,3,Since we are working towards a hierarchical language structure _comma_ we may want the words within constituents correctly tagged _comma_ ready for the next stage of processing .
2114,5,For example _comma_ Milward 1994a provides a dynamic description of a shift reduce parser _comma_ and a dynamic description of a fully incremental parser based on dependency grammar .
2115,5,In cooccurrence smoothing _comma_ as in our method _comma_ a baseline model is combined with a similarity-based model that refines some of its probability estimates .
2116,3,Is such additional complexity really needed .
2117,3,corresponds to rule  .
2118,3,The ` s ( conjunct ( ... ) ) ' rule shown above is a case in point .
2119,5,These authors focus on techniques for providing material that can be used in other processing tasks such as word sense disambiguation _comma_ information retrieval _comma_ natural language generation and so on .
2120,3,The first run was with skipping disabled .
2121,3,Preferences are calculated for 17 cases .
2122,2,Restating the second problem noted in Section  _comma_ if temporal relations can be recovered solely from reasoning with coherence relations _comma_ and the use of the simple past in passage is as felicitous as the past perfect in passage under the Explanation interpretation _comma_ then one asks why passage is not understood as an Explanation as is passage _comma_ where in each case the relationship needs to be inferred .
2123,2,However _comma_ this subset contains just those relations that are predicted to be possible by accounts treating the past perfect as anaphoric ; they are the ones that do not constrain the temporal order of the events against displaying backward progression of time .
2124,3,Spreading activation on the network can directly compute the similarity between any two words in the Longman Defining Vocabulary _comma_ and indirectly the similarity of all the other words in LDOCE .
2125,3,Suppose one is writing an English grammar for the Map Task Corpus _comma_ and that the following is the first attempt at a rule for noun phrases ( with appropriate rules for determiners and nouns ) :
2126,3,The sentence is first decomposed into the broad syntactic categories
2127,5,Grosz and Sidner proposed a theory which accounted for interactions between three notions on discourse : linguistic structure _comma_ intention _comma_ and attention Grosz and Sidner 1986 .
2128,4,However  cannot be expanded out at any constituent level _comma_ whilst retaining an appropriate semantics .
2129,3,In fact _comma_ both ` I collect cake ' and ` I ate too many cakes ' are possible .
2130,3,Grammars based on SDL can generate any context-free language and more than that .
2131,1,In this paper we present a semantic study of motion complexes ( ie. of a motion verb followed by a spatial preposition ) .
2132,4,A shift is inevitable because of constraint 3 _comma_ which states that the  must equal the ( since the is directly realized by the subject of _comma_ `` Friedman '' ) .
2133,3,Without a lexicon _comma_ some initial biasing of the transitions is needed if good results are to be obtained .
2134,5,This sentence seems to get a reading where we are not talking about a particular student ( an outer existential ) _comma_ or about a typical student ( a generic reading ) .
2135,3,Variables introduced by error rules into the surface string are then instantiated by associating surface with lexical _comma_ and matching lexical strings to the lexicon tree ( s ) .
2136,3,Without this principle _comma_ a conversant might not bring up an objection until much later in the conversation _comma_ at which point the relevant belief and some inferences following from that belief will have been added to the common ground as defaults .
2137,2,In the literature of non-incremental generation _comma_ the need for defaults is hardly ever taken into account .
2138,3,The grammar provides full coverage of the following constructions : declarative sentences _comma_ imperatives and questions ( yes / no _comma_ tag and wh-questions ) ; all unbounded dependency types ( topicalisation _comma_ relativisation _comma_ wh-questions ) ; a relatively exhaustive treatment of verb and adjective complement types ; phrasal and prepositional verbs of many complement types ; passivisation ; verb phrase extraposition ; sentence and verb phrase modification ; noun phrase complements and pre - and post-modification ; partitives ; coordination of all major category types ; and nominal and adjectival comparatives .
2139,3,Our work is based on systematic and very detailed linguistic studies which lead to rather complex computations for calculating the spatiotemporal semantics of a motion complex .
2140,3,the following alternative interpretations are given .
2141,5,MDL resolves this trade-off in a disciplined way : It selects a model which is reasonably simple and fits the data satisfactorily as well .
2142,3,Our language is called and its primitive symbols ( with respect to a given signature  ) consists of
2143,3,The precision of 74 % roughly can be interpreted as that for words which take on three different POS s in their POS - class _comma_ the ending-guessing rules will assign four _comma_ but in 95 % of the times ( recall ) the three required POS s will be among the four assigned by the guess .
2144,7,how the knowledge for default handling is described ( see section  ) _comma_ and
2145,5,The inversion process consists of both the automatic static reordering of nodes in the grammar _comma_ and the interchanging of arguments in rules with recursively defined heads .
2146,3,Therefore _comma_ we will measure the similarity between two words with respect to their syntactic behavior to _comma_ say _comma_ their left side by the degree to which they share the same neighbors on the left .
2147,5,Their similarity-based model avoids clustering altogether .
2148,3,Statistical parameters for structural dependency _comma_ lexical transfer _comma_ and linear order are used to select a set of implicit relations between words in a source utterance _comma_ a corresponding set of relations between target language words _comma_ and the most likely translation of the original utterance .
2149,5,As a result _comma_ this work can be viewed as a special case of the intentional view .
2150,2,However _comma_ these approaches have proved too brittle for most interesting natural language problems .
2151,3,As a final example _comma_ consider a sentence which contains a focussed item but no operator for using it up :
2152,3,A final phenomenon concerns shifts of control and the devices used to achieve this .
2153,3,A number of possible extensions to the system can be envisaged .
2154,3,In the second experiment we tagged the same text in the same way but with the small lexicon .
2155,3,This requires interpretation by speaker B before the end of A 's sentence to allow objection to the apposition _comma_ the engine at Avon _comma_ engine E .
2156,3,However _comma_ because both of  and unifies nominative case and agent role _comma_ the costs are equivalent .
2157,3,The other side of the coin _comma_ however _comma_ is a new set of problems that arise in planning actions that satisfy the multiple constraints that arise from the agent 's personal goals and perceived obligations .
2158,3,When we consider full sentence processing _comma_ as opposed to incremental processing _comma_ the use of lexicalised grammars has a major advantage over the use of more standard rule based grammars .
2159,3,The grammar must be finitely ambiguous _comma_ i.e. _comma_ fulfill the off-line parsability constraint Shieber 1989 .
2160,3,However _comma_ there is no reason why automatic clustering should not be attempted even when there are no grounds to expect clearly distinct underlying subpopulations to exist .
2161,1,I have also shown that with a corpus of moderate size it is possible to get reasonable results without using a tagger or parser by employing a customised training pattern .
2162,5,The first directed Applicative CG was proposed by Bar-Hillel 1953 .
2163,3,An alternative is to assume that the temporal ordering between events in two consecutive sentences can be any of the four possibilities ( just_after _comma_ precede _comma_ same-event and overlap ) .
2164,5,Once a discourse is started _comma_ local structures suggest the next objects available .
2165,3,These sets of nodes are equivalence classes .
2166,3,present  ( subgoal 3 ) mark as conveyed
2167,5,The back-off model of Katz 1987 provides a clear separation between frequent events _comma_ for which observed frequencies are reliable probability estimators _comma_ and low-frequency events _comma_ whose prediction must involve additional information sources .
2168,3,We show an example of a Japanese causative auxiliary verb that requires a drastic rearrangement of case domination .
2169,3,Using the WordNet hierarchy as a source of backing-off knowledge _comma_ in such a way that if n-grams composed by c aren't enough to decide the best sense ( are equal to zero ) _comma_ the tri-grams of ancestor classes could be used instead .
2170,2,There is no guarantee _comma_ however _comma_ that the employed smoothing method is in any way consistent with the clustering method used subsequently .
2171,3,where  _comma_ n > 2 .
2172,3,Fig.  shows a paragraph from an article titled `` A Zero-Crossing Rate Which Estimates the Frequency of a Speech Signal _comma_ '' where underlined words indicate connective expressions .
2173,3,TEMP_RELNS : Stores the temporal relations between the eventualities in the discourse .
2174,2,What these approaches have in common is that they classify words instead of individual occurrences .
2175,4,For example _comma_ the glottal stop [ ' 145 ] at the end of a stem may become [ w ] when followed by the relative adjective morpheme { iyy } _comma_ as in Arabic /samaa + iyy/  /samaawiyy/ ` heavenly ' _comma_ but /hawaa + iyy/ /hawaa ' 145 iyy/ ` of air ' .
2176,4,The degree of convergence can be measured using a perplexity measure _comma_ the sum of plog  for hypothesis probabilities p _comma_ which gives an estimate of the degree of disorder in the model .
2177,6,We used as a corpus the 1987 Wall Street Journal in the CD-ROM I Liberman 1991 _comma_ which has a total of 20 M words .
2178,1,In this paper _comma_ we focus on the application of the developed techniques in the context of the comparatively neglected area of HPSG generation .
2179,3,This means that attributes beyond those required for a unique description could be necessary .
2180,3,This limitation can be overcome by moving to a formalism that manipulates trees rather than stacks .
2181,3,We used Wordnet as the verb and noun lexicons for the lemmatizer _comma_ and also as the semantic taxonomy for clustering nouns in semantic classes .
2182,6,The solution given in this paper is to use a higher-order logic programming language _comma_  -Prolog _comma_ that already implements these concepts _comma_ called `` abstract syntax '' in Miller 1991 and `` higher-order abstract syntax '' in Pfenning and Elliot 1988 .
2183,3,Thus achieving mutual belief of understanding is an instance of the type of activity that agents must perform as they collaborate to achieve the purposes of the dialogue .
2184,3,In our model _comma_ each agent associates a numeric confidence value with each of the attributes in the referring expression _comma_ and by composing these _comma_ computes a level of confidence in the adequacy of the complete referring expression plan that can be interpreted as ranging from low confidence to high confidence .
2185,3,where T is a value between zero and one .
2186,5,As has been amply demonstrated over the last fifteen years _comma_ this view permits perspicuous analyses of a wide variety of linguistic data .
2187,2,This can lead to nontermination as the tree fragments enumerated in bottom-up evaluation of magic compiled grammars are connected Johnson forthcoming .
2188,5,-Prolog is a logic programming language based on higher-order hereditary Harrop formulae Miller et al. 1991 .
2189,3,Once the root spelling patterns and the affix combinations pointing to them have been created _comma_ analysis essentially reduces to an instance of affix-stripping _comma_ which would be amenable to exactly the technique outlined by Carter 1992 .
2190,1,We attempt to evaluate two different approaches to anaphoric processing in discourse by comparing the accuracy and coverage of two published algorithms for finding the co-specifiers of pronouns in naturally occurring texts and dialogues .
2191,3,There are three basic phases to this algorithm .
2192,3,A prototype can be accessed via the Internet _comma_ on which users can try their own text ( details from the authors ) .
2193,3,Although both algorithms are part of theories of discourse that posit the interaction of the algorithm with an inference or intentional component _comma_ we will not use reasoning in tandem with the algorithm 's operation .
2194,3,Immediate plans include a larger scale version of the experiment presented here _comma_ involving thesaurus classes _comma_ as well as a similarly designed evaluation of how the algorithm fares when presented with noun groups produced by distributional clustering .
2195,5,Earlier work of the author Feldweg 1993 and Feldweg 1995a within the framework of a project on corpus based development of lexical knowledge bases ( ELWIS ) has produced LIKELY _comma_ a straightforward implementation of the Viterbi algorithm employing an HMM whose parameters were obtained from a pre-tagged text corpus .
2196,3,The entries are sorted by decreasing frequencies relative to the total number of mismatches between the manually and automatically tagged texts .
2197,2,it allows one to represent the different kinds of evidence for mutual belief ;
2198,2,Researchers have studied the analysis and generation of arguments Birnbaum et al. 1980 _comma_ Reichman 1981 _comma_ Cohen 1987 _comma_ Sycara 1989 _comma_ Quilici 1992 _comma_ Maybury 1993 ; however _comma_ agents engaging in argumentative dialogues are solely interested in winning an argument and thus exhibit different behavior from collaborative agents .
2199,4,This is not surprising given that natural language _comma_ at least in written form _comma_ is explicitly symbolic .
2200,5,We are trying to find the antecedent for her in the second utterance .
2201,3,The two ` mass ' environments shown in Table  are used to show the countability of nouns that can be either countable or uncountable .
2202,3,allowing for underlying assumptions _comma_
2203,3,The paper includes a brief discussion of the relationship between basic Categorial Grammar and other formalisms such as HPSG _comma_ Dependency Grammar and the Lambek Calculus .
2204,3,The Narration relation is characterized by a series of events displaying forward movement of time _comma_ such as in passage  ) .
2205,2,Therefore it is much narrower notion .
2206,3,Each type of IRU _comma_ the assumption addressed and the evidence type provided is given in Figure  .
2207,3,An apparent local minimum in the space  may no longer be a local minimum in the space ; the extra dimension may provide a pathway for further improvement of the hypothesis grammar .
2208,4,Such distributions are referred to as ` dendroid distributions ' in the literature .
2209,3,As has already been noted _comma_ the basic entities underlying the LFG analyses are composite structures consisting of a finite tree _comma_ a finite feature structure _comma_ and a function that links the two .
2210,3,The higher-order unification method developed by Dalrymple et al. 1991 could be used for this purpose ; in this case the sentence-level semantics is recovered without copying any syntactic representations .
2211,3,The fourth line of table  represents a special case of this error for which the HMM model can not be held responsible : no ambiguity was indicated in the lexicon _comma_ so the model had nothing to choose from .
2212,3,Disambiguation is performed with respect to WordNet senses _comma_ which are fairly fine-grained ; however _comma_ the method also permits the assignment of higher-level WordNet categories rather than sense labels .
2213,5,He goes on to say _comma_ `` just how far information in the sound structure of the input can bootstrap the acquisition of other levels [ of linguistic organization ] remains to be determined . ''
2214,4,One is a syntagmatic relation : how the words are arranged in sequential texts .
2215,4,The grammarian is accomplishing two critical tasks : identifying the features which are relevant to each decision _comma_ and deciding which choice to select based on the values of the relevant features .
2216,3,Future work should extend these results _comma_ showing that a ` cooperative strategy ' need not always be ` cooperative ' _comma_ and investigate additional factors that determine when strategies are effective .
2217,3,The class accumulates enough evidence provided by erroneously extracted triples .
2218,3,Our goal was three-fold .
2219,3,a tokenizer that recognizes words in free text .
2220,3,Whenever a linguistic object is recognized _comma_ it is thrown into the solution of ChAM _comma_ and acts as a molecule .
2221,2,However _comma_ they were derived manually through psychological experiments .
2222,3,One can then go back to the grammar and see that the noun phrase rule needs to be changed to account for certain types of modifier including adjectives and adverbial modifiers .
2223,3,For example _comma_ verbs taking bare infinitives were classified as adverbs since this is too rare a phenomenon to provide strong distributional evidence ( `` we do not DARE speak of '' _comma_ `` legislation could HELP remove '' ) .
2224,3,We also compared initiative in Task Oriented and Advice Giving dialogues and found that both allocation of control and the manner in which control is transferred is radically different for the two dialogue types .
2225,5,Subsequent treatments of non-peripheral extraction based on the Lambek Calculus ( where standard composition is built in : it is a rule which can be proven from the calculus ) have either introduced an alternative to the forward and backward slashes i.e. / and  for normal args _comma_ for wh-args Moortgat 1988 _comma_ or have introduced so called modal operators on the wh-argument Morrill et al. 1990 .
2226,3,In order to reconcile computational feasibility to empirical realism an appropriate form of language representation is critical .
2227,4,Without loss of generality _comma_ any n-dimensional joint distribution can be written as
2228,2,Furthermore _comma_ Martinovic and Strzalkowski 1992 and others have observed that a simple head-first reordering of the grammar rules may still make insufficient restricting information available for generation unless the form of the grammar is restricted to unary or binary rules .
2229,3,Here is a typical example of tagging a text of 5970 words .
2230,3,Move 2 : Create a rule of the form
2231,3,Successful treatment of non-constituent coordination using phrasal coordination seems to require elaborate encoding in the conjunct type of a simple generalisation : conjuncts can coordinate provided they are acceptable within the same syntactic context .
2232,3,This makes the accuracy drop caused by the cascading guesser to be less than 6 % in general .
2233,3,The four arguments to coord are a category and three terms that are the object-level LF representations of constituents of that category .
2234,4,Why should we _comma_ as computational linguists _comma_ be interested in factors that contribute to the interactivity of a discourse ?
2235,4,A restriction that leaves its proposed linguistic applications intact is to admit a type  only as the argument type in functional applications _comma_ but never as the functor .
2236,5,Lexicalist approaches to MT _comma_ particularly those incorporating the technique of Shake-and-Bake generation Beaven 1992a _comma_ Beaven 1992b _comma_ Whitelock 1994 _comma_ combine the linguistic advantages of transfer Arnold et al. 1988 _comma_ Allegranza et al. 1991 and interlingual Nirenburg et al. 1992 _comma_ Dorr 1993 approaches .
2237,5,As we traverse the tree of  _comma_ the first NP we encounter is _comma_ so Lyn 's mom is proposed as the antecedent for her and we are done .
2238,3,Now _comma_ any non-terminal node in the c-structure should satisfy one of these disjunctions ( that is _comma_ each sub-tree of c-struct must be licensed by one of these conditions ) ; moreover the disjunction is irrelevant to the terminal nodes of c-struct and all the nodes in f-struct .
2239,3,A related _comma_ though not identical factor is whether the language being analysed is produced by more than one person _comma_ although this distinction may be conflated in textual material such as novels that contain reported conversations .
2240,5,Associative CGs with Composition _comma_ or the Lambek Calculus also allow strings such as boy with the to be given the type n / n predicting very boy with the car to be an acceptable noun .
2241,3,This is just the kind of object required for a discourse operator such as contrast or elaboration -- exactly which such operator is appropriate depends on factors not visible in  itself _comma_ but whatever it is it will require a pair of arguments of this kind .
2242,4,Ellipsis is pervasive in natural language _comma_ and hence has received much attention within both computational and theoretical linguistics .
2243,5,In those models _comma_ the relationship between given words is modeled by analogy with other words that are in some sense similar to the given ones .
2244,7,In this section _comma_ we elaborate on the merits of our method .
2245,3,The word we are interested in is  .
2246,3,In Table  some results of that experiment are shown .
2247,3,assign thesaurus categories to all words
2248,3,The results appear in table  _comma_ showing the best accuracy achieved ( on ambiguous words ) .
2249,5,This phenomenon is analysed by McCarthy 1981 along the lines of autosegmental phonology Goldsmith 1976 .
2250,3,Whereas _comma_ as for the editorials _comma_ the average length ratio ( abstract / original ) was 30 % _comma_ and the coverage of the key sentence and the most important key sentence were 41 % and 60 % respectively .
2251,3,First _comma_ setting certain parameters a set of guessing rules is acquired _comma_ then it is evaluated and the results of evaluation are used for re-acquisition of a better tuned rule-set .
2252,3,In this section _comma_ we regard categories as polymorphic types and consider the type calculus .
2253,3,The function was then incorporated into the evaluation functions of two implemented non-deterministic search algorithms .
2254,2,One of the important points of this work is that statistical models of natural language should not be restricted to simple _comma_ context-insensitive models .
2255,6,In this section we define a grammar similar to Bar-Hillel 's first grammar .
2256,3,It is interesting to note that a textbook method for constructing decision trees for classification from attribute-value pairs is to minimize the ( weighted average of the ) remaining entropy over all possible choices of root attribute Quinlan 1986 .
2257,3,is weighted activity of the nodes referred in the rfr of :
2258,3,A method of representing a sequence must be chosen .
2259,4,Examples of such cooccurrences include relationships between head words in syntactic constructions ( verb-object or adjective-noun _comma_ for example ) and word sequences ( n-grams ) .
2260,7,Section  provides a general description for defaults in generation emphasizing the specific requirements in an incremental system .
2261,5,Incremental interpretation was considered to be useful in enabling immediate visual feedback .
2262,3,For each text we performed two tagging experiments .
2263,3,modal operators for talking about trees
2264,3,The paper aims to escape from such dead-end situations by making assumptions .
2265,3,Apply the anaphora module first .
2266,4,First _comma_ a more empirical approach is being adopted to grammar development whereby the rule set is modified according to its performance against corpora of natural text Taylor et al. 1989 .
2267,5,Solomonoff 's induction framework is not restricted to probabilistic context-free grammars .
2268,5,An agent can infer a plan even if it is invalid in that agent 's view Pollack 1990 .
2269,3,This shows the neccesity to take into account such language specific behaviour in natural languages understanding systems and in natural languages machine translation .
2270,5,In generation _comma_ examples of such extended processing strategies are head corner generation with its semantic linking Shieber et al. 1990 or bottom-up ( Earley ) generation with a semantic filter Shieber 1988 .
2271,3,We require that subtrees of the mother that are passed to daughters that share subtrees with one another must appear as siblings in the mother 's tree .
2272,2,For example _comma_ fragmentary utterances may be interpreted with respect to the previous user input _comma_ but what users say is often in reaction to the system 's previous response Cohen and Perrault 1982 _comma_ Sidner 1983 .
2273,3,` ignore ' rules may be invoked ;
2274,3,Such interaction _comma_ while interesting in its own right _comma_ is also a good test-bed for theories of the semantic interpretation of temporal expressions .
2275,2,Often variants do not neatly line up on two sides of a line _comma_ but are intermixed haphazardly .
2276,3,For example _comma_ sentence  will be ruled out because the cue phrase as a result conflicts with the temporal expression ten minutes earlier :
2277,3,Moreover _comma_ since a daughter shares subtrees with itself _comma_ a special case of the condition is that subtrees occurring within some daughter can only appear as siblings in the mother .
2278,3,We propose that control segments correspond to different subgoals in the evolving discourse plan .
2279,3,Present each remaining training corpus sentence in turn _comma_ initially creating an additional singleton cluster  for it .
2280,4,Consider the following sentences :
2281,5,Fuzisaki et al. applied the HMM model to segmentation and probabilistic CFG to analyzing the structure of compound nouns Fijisaki et al. 1991 .
2282,3,There are cases where a degree of inference seems to be required :
2283,5,In order to detect the SRs that a word imposes in its context by means of statistical techniques two distinct approaches have been proposed : word-based Church et al. 1991 _comma_ and class-based Basili et al. 1992 _comma_ Resnik 1992 .
2284,1,In this paper we consider various potential applications _comma_ in particular graphical interaction and dialogue .
2285,3,ASPECT : simple _comma_ perf _comma_ prog _comma_ perf_prog .
2286,5,Unlike most linguistic theories _comma_ LFG Kaplan and Bresnan 1982 treats grammatical relations as first class citizens .
2287,3,The process of generalizing or smoothing the transition probabilities is therefore seen to be indispensable .
2288,3,where  and are the sum of weighted activity ( at time T ) of the nodes referred in the rfrant and rfr respectively .
2289,5,This takes fragments of sentences and maps them to unscoped logical forms .
2290,5,Finally _comma_ it ends up with an utterance .
2291,5,A final more indirect cue to discourse structure is the speaker 's choice of referring expressions and grammatical structure .
2292,3,This latter point is especially important in cases where a grammar must be usable to some degree at a relatively early stage in its development _comma_ as is _comma_ for example _comma_ the case with the development of a grammar for the Map Task Corpus .
2293,3,Thus A 's strategy choice may depend on A 's model of B 's attentional state _comma_ as well as the costs of retrieval and inference as opposed to communication .
2294,3,Thus what we are evaluating is the extent to which these algorithms suffice to narrow the search of an inference component .
2295,1,This paper focuses on the evaluation and modification of proposed beliefs _comma_ and details a strategy for engaging in collaborative negotiations .
2296,2,Finally _comma_ while we have used our similarity model only for missing bigrams in a back-off scheme _comma_ Essen and Steinbiss 1992 used linear interpolation for all bigrams to combine the cooccurrence smoothing model with MLE models of bigrams and unigrams .
2297,3,The full processing model can then be either serial _comma_ exploring the most highly ranked transitions first ( but allowing backtracking if the semantic plausibility of the current interpretation drops too low ) _comma_ or ranked parallel _comma_ exploring just the n paths ranked highest according to the transition probabilities and semantic plausibility .
2298,1,A comparison was made of co-occurrence vectors from large text corpora and of distance vectors from dictionary definitions .
2299,3,Figure  shows the five words most similar to the each cluster centroid for the four clusters resulting from the first two cluster splits .
2300,3,With the mixed entropy scheme it seems important to include the restrictions on neighbouring cutnodes _comma_ while this does not seem to be the case with the RHS phrase entropy scheme .
2301,2,In contrast with operators employed in RST-based planners that split goals according to the rhetorical structures _comma_ our operators encode standard schemata for presenting proofs _comma_ which contain subgoals .
2302,2,This type of reference is different from the type that has been studied traditionally by researchers who have usually assumed that the agents have mutual knowledge of the referent Appelt 1985a _comma_ Appelt and Kronfeld 1987 _comma_ Clark and Wilkes-Gibbs 1986 _comma_ Heeman and Hirst 1992 _comma_ Searle 1969 _comma_ are copresent with the referent Heeman and Hirst 1992 _comma_ Cohen 1981 _comma_ or have the referent in their focus of attention Reiter and Dale 1992 .
2303,5,However _comma_ Vijay-Shanker and Weir 1993 demonstrate that polynomial time performance can be achieved through the use of structure-sharing made possible by constraints in the way that LIG use stacks .
2304,3,First _comma_ we give DAG 's for each lexical items in Fig  .
2305,5,A lexical-semantic transfer phase which employs the bilingual dictionary to map the bag of instantiated source signs onto a bag of target language signs .
2306,7,I then show how the general model of the previous section is instantiated for this language .
2307,3,The input proof tree is also augmented with an ordered list of nodes _comma_ being roots of subproofs planned in this order .
2308,3,So perhaps it is worth investing effort in hand-tagging training corpora after all _comma_ rather than just building a lexicon and letting re-estimation sort out the probabilities .
2309,3,For convenience we will call this the substring hypothesis .
2310,5,He showed that _comma_ for languages at least as high in the Chomsky hierarchy as CFGs _comma_ inference from positive data alone is strictly less powerful than inference from both positive and negative data together .
2311,4,In  _comma_ the corrected material the three main sources of data come provides the antecedent for the pronoun they .
2312,1,This paper provides a theoretical framework _comma_ called stratified logic _comma_ that can accommodate defeasible pragmatic inferences .
2313,3,The impact of noise provided by erroneous extraction of co-occurrence triples _comma_ in the acquisition of wrong semantic classes _comma_ seems to be very moderate .
2314,1,This paper shows how the use of abstract syntax permitted by higher-order logic programming allows an elegant implementation of the semantics of Combinatory Categorial Grammar _comma_ including its handling of coordination constructs .
2315,3,Our experimental results indicate that combining an automatically constructed thesaurus and a hand made thesaurus widens the coverage of our disambiguation method _comma_ while maintaining high accuracy .
2316,3,This is reasonable since with a small data size most case slots cannot be determined to be dependent with any significance .
2317,3,we get general results on a methodology for doing evaluation _comma_
2318,3,The default for missing number information in VM-GEN would look as follows :
2319,3,In contrast to LIG _comma_ PLPATR licenses structure sharing on the right hand side of productions .
2320,2,In the presence of models with varying complexity _comma_ MLE tends to overfit the data _comma_ and output a model that is too complex and tailored to fit the specifics of the input data .
2321,1,The parsing problem for SDL _comma_ however _comma_ we have shown to be NP-complete .
2322,3,Observe that for partial downstep _comma_ it is necessary to have two downsteps before a high tone is at the level of a preceding low _comma_ while for total downstep _comma_ it is only necessary to have a single downstep for a high tone to be at the same level as the preceding low .
2323,3,for each  _comma_ [ for some _comma_ runs to q ' in F _comma_ ] ] where runs to q ' in F iff [ _comma_
2324,3,It may seem worrying that some of the tags are assigned a high number of clusters ( e.g. _comma_ 49 for N _comma_ 36 for ADN ) .
2325,5,It has been suggested that only world knowledge allows one to detect that the default is being overridden here .
2326,3,Along with new processing for the generation of articles _comma_ which is not discussed in detail in this paper _comma_ it improved the percentage of noun phrases with correctly generated determiners and number from 65 % to 73 % .
2327,4,Generalizing case frame slots within these case frames _comma_
2328,3,Ascriptive noun phrases whose subject is countable will also be denumerated .
2329,5,Thus _comma_ in interpreting _comma_
2330,5,The similarity measure  is symmetric in the sense that and are identical up to frequency normalization _comma_ that is .
2331,5,M and C illustrate the problem by considering the fragment Mary thinks John .
2332,3,You have an existing pension plan .
2333,4,Lexicography is also interested in the acquisition of SRs .
2334,4,Taggers assign a single POS - tag to a word-token _comma_ provided that it is known what parts-of-speech this word can take on in principle .
2335,3,u is an object in I _comma_ and
2336,3,Figure  shows a ` minimal pair ' of DRS 's for sentence _comma_ one according to Partee 1984 's analysis and one according to ours .
2337,3,Although Schabes 1991 claims that the problem of exponential grammar complexity `` is particularly acute for natural language processing since in this context the input length is typically small ( 10 - 20 words ) and the grammar size very large ( hundreds or thousands of rules and symbols ) '' _comma_ the experiments indicate that _comma_ with a wide-coverage NL grammar _comma_ inputs of this length can be parsed quite quickly ; however _comma_ longer inputs ( of more than about 30 words in length ) -- which occur relatively frequently in written text -- are a problem .
2338,5,Thus _comma_ rather than storing the whole of the potentially unbounded stack in a particular array entry _comma_ it suffices to store just a bounded portion together with a pointer to the residue .
2339,3,The categorization of verb phrases into different aspectual classes can be phrased in terms of which part of the nucleus they refer to .
2340,3,Most commonly they combine easily computed text measures _comma_ typically average or sampled average sentence length combined with similarly computed word length _comma_ or incidence of words not on a specified `` easy word list '' Chall 1948 _comma_ Klare 1963 .
2341,3,Therefore _comma_ such forms are anaphoric in the semantics _comma_ but do not leave behind an empty constituent in the syntax .
2342,3,This suggests a need for the more abstract level of description which dynamic grammars provide .
2343,3,As a baseline _comma_ ten runs were done selecting senses by random choice _comma_ with the average percent correct being 33.3 % _comma_ standard deviation 3.83 .
2344,3,But having done the hand-simulation in order to produce such numbers _comma_ all of this information is available .
2345,3,Since guessing rules are meant to capture general language regularities the lexicon should be as general as possible ( list all possible POS s for a word ) and as large as possible .
2346,3,Summarizing _comma_ 2_comma_372 ( 89.2 % ) of the triples in the testing set were considered to be correctly extracted and lemmatized .
2347,1,In order to make a generation method available for grammars which do not follow the strict notion of a semantic head _comma_ a syntactic-head-driven generation algorithm is presented _comma_ which can be specialized to generate from UDRSs .
2348,5,This work also employs a heuristic search within a Bayes -ian framework .
2349,3,The system is now utilized as a text browser for a prototypical interactive document retrieval system .
2350,3,An example _comma_ which is well studied in psycholinguistics _comma_ is the utterance of a noun before the verb has been chosen .
2351,2,While theoretically possible _comma_ it becomes quite problematic to actually implement .
2352,2,When comparing how various sites pronounce the first consonant of a particular word _comma_ it is meaningless to ask that question if the site does not use that word .
2353,5,Preparing tagged corpora by hand is labour-intensive and potentially error-prone _comma_ and although a semi-automatic approach can be used Marcus et al. 1993 _comma_ it is a good thing to reduce the human involvement as much as possible .
2354,3,Figure  says that prompts _comma_ repetitions _comma_ paraphrases and making inferences explicit all provide linguistic evidence of attention .
2355,2,Previously _comma_ it has been necessary to specify the tree-cutting criteria ( or operationality criteria ) manually ; here they are derived automatically from the training set and the desired coverage of the specialized grammar .
2356,3,The rule of State-Prediction is obtained by further generalising to allow the lexical item to have missing arguments _comma_ and for the expected argument to have missing arguments .
2357,2,Our work differs from theirs in scope and also in the exploration of various other directions .
2358,3,A verb partition  is defined analogously .
2359,1,This paper proposes a processing-conforming default handler for generation realizing repair by non-monotonic changes .
2360,3,As in unsupervised learning _comma_ the goal is to learn the underlying distribution of the data .
2361,3,Our microplanner is restricted to the treatment of the reference choices for the inference methods and for the previously presented intermediate conclusions .
2362,3,This work was supported ( in part ) by Korea Science and Engineering Foundation ( KOSEF ) through Center for Artificial Intelligence Research ( CAIR ) _comma_ the Engineering Research Center ( ERC ) of Excellence Program .
2363,1,whether the form leaves behind an empty constituent in the syntax _comma_ and
2364,4,In addition to the basic message _comma_ however _comma_ they also carry information about what I didn't do .
2365,3,`` correct - A '' also requires that the words within the subject are correctly tagged .
2366,5,Note also that the Cb of Grosz et al. 1986 corresponds roughly to Sidner 's discourse focus and the Cf to her potential foci .
2367,1,We have shown how a simple experiment in changing the tagset shows that the relationship between tagset size and accuracy is a weak one and is not consistent against languages .
2368,3,This work has been supported in part by the Ministry for Science and Research of the Land Baden-Wrttemberg under the project `` Corpus Based Development of Lexical Knowledge Bases ( ELWIS ) '' and by the Commission of the European Community under the LRE project `` Adapting Bilingual Dictionaries for Online Assistance ( COMPASS _comma_ LRE 62 - 080 ) '' .
2369,5,Call this node X _comma_ and call the path used to reach it p .
2370,3,Our model provides a basic scheme for probabilistic similarity-based estimation that can be developed in several directions .
2371,1,Based on this model _comma_ lexical selection neural networks are implemented for a connectionist transfer project in machine translation .
2372,3,The translation relation is expressed by a set of first order axioms which are used by a theorem prover to derive a target language logical form that is equivalent ( in some context ) to the source logical form .
2373,2,It can also handle 6 % less unknown words which _comma_ in fact _comma_ might decrease its performance even lower .
2374,3,The interpretation of only and focussed negation is fairly straightforward _comma_ so long as the treatment of the focussed item itself is coherent .
2375,6,The system described is a component of the Core Language Engine ( CLE ) Alshawi 1992 _comma_ a general-purpose language analyser and generator implemented in Prolog which supports both a built-in lexicon and access to large external lexical databases .
2376,3,A follow-up to this work might be to apply similar tests in other languages to provide a further confirmation of the results _comma_ and to see if language families which similar characteristics can be identified .
2377,3,In fact _comma_ the agent might have an explicit goal not to answer the question _comma_ yet still is obliged to offer a response ( e.g. _comma_ consider most politicians at press conferences ) .
2378,2,However _comma_ the superiority of n-gram models in the part-of-speech domain indicates that to be competitive in modeling naturally-occurring data _comma_ it is necessary to model collocational information accurately .
2379,5,It is only at the sentence level in simple narrative texts that the presentation order and the natural order of evaluation necessarily coincide .
2380,3,In an effort to compare the German model with what is reported for other languages _comma_ English and French tagged texts were analysed .
2381,3,With our integrated heuristic scheme _comma_ good / close parses were returned in 30 sentences ( 6 additional sentences ) .
2382,4,Ordinarily _comma_ the input of such a system is a sequence of words .
2383,6,The research reported is in a similar vein to that of _comma_ for example _comma_ Moore and Dowding 1991 _comma_ Samuelsson and Rayner 1991 _comma_ and Maxwell and Kaplan 1993 _comma_ in that it relies on empirical results for the study and optimisation of parsing algorithms rather than on traditional techniques of complexity analysis .
2384,7,We conclude with the following remarks .
2385,3,Therefore _comma_ the second event is constrained to preceding the first :
2386,4,Consider _comma_ for example _comma_ the cluster containing attorney _comma_ counsel _comma_ trial _comma_ court _comma_ and judge _comma_ used by Brown et al. 1992 to illustrate a `` semantically sticky '' group of words .
2387,3,We obtain a sequence of transitions as follows :
2388,2,The analysis in Partee 1984 of quantified sentences _comma_ introduced by a temporal connective _comma_ gives the wrong truth-conditions when the temporal connective in the subordinate clause is before or after .
2389,2,Although this notion of observer shares a large part with PIVOT of Iida-Sells 1988 _comma_ our notion of observer is introduced only by garu .
2390,5,For Siadhail _comma_ the ultimate scientific justification in adopting the three-dialect account is the fact that the Gaeltacht ( Irish-speaking territory ) is so fragmented nowadays that it no longer forms a continuum .
2391,4,Namely the scope of the operation of these auxiliary verbs is not the operated verb but the whole sentence .
2392,3,The sentences were created by the authors to exhibit at least a degree of ambiguity when it came to attaching a post-verbal phrase as an adjunct or a complement .
2393,3,In the present case _comma_ the first of these consequences means that I did indeed borrow a car :
2394,3,The model presented here allows naturally for a mixed-initiative conversation and varying levels of co-operativity .
2395,4,One of the valuable indicators of the structure of text is lexical cohesion Halliday and Hasan 1976 .
2396,3,Another avenue for improvement is to provide the guessing rules with the probabilities of emission of POS s from their resulting POS - classes .
2397,3,The following is an example of a LHIP rule .
2398,6,This work demonstrates that Solomonoff 's elegant framework deserves much further consideration .
2399,3,The former splits the task of presenting a particular proof into subtasks of presenting subproofs .
2400,3,There are three main methods by which this sharing of structure can be achieved : phrasal coordination _comma_ 3-D coordination _comma_ and processing strategies .
2401,2,This result marks the first time a grammar-based language model has surpassed n-gram modeling in a task of at least moderate size .
2402,2,We have also argued that an architecture that uses obligations provides a much simpler implementation than the strong plan-based approaches .
2403,3,I derive an F  prediction function from first principles and show how the model of Liberman et al. 1993 for the Nigerian language Igbo is a special case .
2404,5,There are many different criteria for quantifying the ( dis ) similarity between ( analyses of ) two sentences or between two clusters of sentences ; Everitt 1993 provides a good overview .
2405,3,Partial and total downstep can be visualised as follows _comma_ where the dotted lines indicate the abstract register inside which tones are scaled _comma_ and where downstep corresponds to lowering of the register .
2406,3,The example points out that the translation strategy is a mixture of transfer and interlingua .
2407,3,Class 49 consists of proper nouns .
2408,2,The problem with this approach is that the cue may only be an infrequent indicator of a particular type of shift .
2409,1,It is our aim to provide such an approach here .
2410,3,It is certainly a precise picture ( all three components _comma_ and how they are related are well defined ) _comma_ but _comma_ just as importantly _comma_ it is also a faithful picture ; models capture the LFG ontology perspicuously .
2411,3,We assume that generation is a decision-making process with the aim of producing a plausible utterance based on given information .
2412,4,Presumably _comma_ classifying a system as symbolic must refer to a different set of ( internal ) symbols _comma_ but even this does not rule out many statistical systems modeling events involving nonterminal categories and word senses .
2413,3,For the third domain _comma_ we took English text and reduced the size of the vocabulary by mapping each word to its part-of-speech tag .
2414,3,Note that incremental interpretation will be of no use here _comma_ since the semantic representation should be no more or less plausible in the different languages .
2415,3,Event anaphora clustered at segment boundaries when it was used to refer to preceding segments and was more likely to cross segment boundaries because of its function in talking about the proposed plan .
2416,3,Tag disambiguation is part of the parsing task _comma_ handled by the neural net and its pre-processor .
2417,3,The order in which the two modules are called is based on efficiency deduced from statistical data performed on COBALT corpuses .
2418,5,Note that Fig.  represents not only the hierarchical structure but also the word order of a complex sentence in Japanese .
2419,5,On the other hand _comma_ Lascarides and Asher 1993 take the view that temporal relations are resolved purely as a by-product of reasoning about coherence relations holding between utterances _comma_ and in doing so _comma_ argue that treating simple and complex tenses as anaphoric is unnecessary .
2420,5,Hindle and Rooth also used collocational information to solve ambiguities of pp-attachment in English Hindle and Rooth 1991 .
2421,3,is a total function from Q to _comma_ and
2422,5,Everyone in P has reason to believe that  holds .
2423,5,Therefore _comma_ distance vectors can be expected to convey almost the same information as the entire network _comma_ and clearly they are much easier to handle .
2424,6,The method is based on earlier simulation work by Carletta and Pollack Carletta 1992 _comma_ Pollack and Ringuette 1990 .
2425,3,When planning _comma_ an agent considers both its goals and obligations in order to determine an action that addresses both to the extent possible .
2426,3,The typing of a collocation with such a function opens up the way to a treatment of collocations inside a given language module and hence to a substantial reduction in the number of collocations explicitly handled in the multilingual transfer dictionary .
2427,2,in the two contexts
2428,3,For unit clauses _comma_ the priority is identified with the preference value .
2429,3,Second _comma_ when the disjunction  has just been presented in the bottom-up mode _comma_ tested by ( local-focus ) .
2430,3,describes an activity and describes an atelic _comma_ or
2431,5,Structure-sharing can therefore be used effectively because checking the applicability of rules at each step in the derivation involves the comparison of structures of limited size .
2432,3,Suppose that  is a tone sequence where the F value of is x .
2433,3,More generally _comma_ suppose that we have a sequence of two arbitrary tones .
2434,4,A Semitic stem consists of a root and a vowel melody _comma_ arranged according to a canonical pattern .
2435,3,First _comma_ we concentrated on finding the best thresholds  for the rule-sets .
2436,3,Thus _comma_ although somewhat overly harsh _comma_ the heuristic is quite effective in identifying bad parses .
2437,1,Our goal is to generalize the constraints inherent in LIG _comma_ to a formalism that manipulates feature structures rather than stacks .
2438,5,Without the need to rely on notions such as semantic head and chain rule _comma_ a head corner behavior can be mimicked in a strict bottom-up fashion .
2439,3,First _comma_ the treebank is partitioned into a training set and a test set .
2440,3,This seems intuitively plausible and means that the strength of belief depends on the strength of underlying assumptions _comma_ and that for all inference rules that depend on multiple premises _comma_ the strength of an inferred belief is the weakest of the supporting beliefs .
2441,5,That is to say _comma_ ` Comment ' is recursively defined .
2442,2,However _comma_ evaluating the head of a construction prior to its dependent subparts still suffers from efficiency problems when the head of a construction is either missing _comma_ displaced or underspecified .
2443,3,In later sections we denote categories by DAG ( directed acyclic graph ) of PATR grammar Shieber 1986 .
2444,3,Finally _comma_ an experimental evaluation of these variations is reported .
2445,3,The transfer dictionary includes the information that in this case _comma_ NP 1 should be generic .
2446,3,adjective vs. noun ( demi _comma_ moyen _comma_ responsable _comma_
2447,5,Earley deduction Pereira and Warren 1983 is based on grammars encoded as definite clauses .
2448,3,divide the above words in the middle to produce pairs of two kanzi character words ; if one is not in the thesaurus _comma_ this four kanzi character word is discarded ( section  )
2449,3,The class guesser also takes care of POS-assignment for abbreviations _comma_ special symbol sequences and language external material in the text .
2450,3,At any given time _comma_ an agent may have many obligations and many different goals _comma_ and planning involves a complex tradeoff between these different factors .
2451,4,combine modules from different systems .
2452,5,where  denotes the unsmoothed parameter .
2453,2,However the constraints and rules from Grosz et al. 1986 would fail to make a choice here between the co-specification possibilities for the pronouns in .
2454,5,First _comma_ Lascarides and Asher note the incoherence of example
2455,1,We have developed a computational model of discourse for Japanese expository writings _comma_ and implemented a practical procedure for extracting discourse structure Sumita 1992 .
2456,3,For example _comma_ height and architectural style can be very salient features for describing a building _comma_ but not for describing an intersection _comma_ for which having a sign or traffic lights is important .
2457,5,By Grosz et al. 1986 a shift occurs whenever successive Cb 's are not the same .
2458,3,B to s
2459,3,Although these embody the spirit of the constraints found in Chomsky 1981 they are not intended to be entirely faithful to this specification of syntactic theory .
2460,3,Our work is supported by the University of Toronto and by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada .
2461,3,Strongly countable nouns will be countable and plural in such mass - countable environments as the object of collect ( vt ) : ` I collect cakes ' _comma_ and uncountable and singular in mass - uncountable environments such as ` I ate too much cake ' .
2462,3,Questions do more than just provide evidence of a speaker 's goals _comma_ and something more than adoption of the goals of an interlocutor is involved in formulating a response to a question .
2463,3,The model we propose is that an agent 's behavior is determined by a number of factors _comma_ including that agent 's current goals in the domain _comma_ and a set of obligations that are induced by a set of social conventions .
2464,3,The dataflow analysis is used to determine the relative efficiency of a particular evaluation order of the right-hand side categories in a phrase structure rule by computing the maximal degree of nondeterminacy introduced by the evaluation of each of these categories .
2465,5,Reichenbach 's well - known account of the interpretation of the different tense forms uses the temporal relations between three temporal indices : the utterance time _comma_ event time and reference time .
2466,3,We first allocate an appropriate probability mass for unseen cooccurrences following the back-off method .
2467,3,This could be in the nature of fixed restrictions to the rules e.g. for English we might rule out uses of prediction when a noun phrase is encountered _comma_ and two already exist on the left list .
2468,2,However _comma_ it is not clear how well the directed methods are applicable to grammars which do not depend on concatenation and have no unique ` left corner ' which should be connected to the start symbol .
2469,7,In the following sections _comma_ we will sketch the basic algorithm _comma_ consider how to provide it with an initial guess _comma_ and provide an informal proof of its efficiency .
2470,5,The lexicalist approach to Machine Translation offers significant advantages in the development of linguistic descriptions .
2471,6,Our choice is the MDL ( Minimum Description Length ) principle Rissanen 1978 _comma_ Rissanen 1983 _comma_ Rissanen 1984 _comma_ Rissanen 1986 _comma_ Rissanen 1989 _comma_ a well-known principle of data compression and statistical estimation from information theory .
2472,1,The paper describes a substitutional approach to ellipsis resolution giving comparable results to Dalrymple et al. 1991 _comma_ but without the need for order-sensitive interleaving of quantifier scoping and ellipsis resolution .
2473,7,The rest of this section focuses on two related works on measuring paradigmatic similarity -- a psycholinguistic approach and a thesaurus-based approach .
2474,5,This smoothing is also performed on the Inside-Outside post-pass of our algorithm .
2475,5,The resulting evaluation strategy is similar to that of the head-corner approach Shieber et al. 1990 _comma_ Gerdemann and Hinrichs in press : prediction follows the main flow of semantic information until a lexical pivot is reached _comma_ and only then are the head-dependent subparts of the construction built up in a bottom-up fashion .
2476,5,Proponents of the Shake-and-Bake approach have employed various techniques to improve generation efficiency .
2477,2,It is also sometimes frustrating that the linguistic knowledge used to create the initial biases gets `` optimized '' or `` trained '' away in subsequent iterations of training .
2478,3,The agent now has to be realized as part of a `` von '' - phrase _comma_ e.g .
2479,2,By combining the off-line optimization process with a mixed bottom-up / top-down evaluation strategy _comma_ we can refrain from a complete reformulation of the grammar as _comma_ for example _comma_ in Minnen et al. 1995 .
2480,3,After completing the implementation of our move set _comma_ we plan to explore the modeling of context-sensitive phenomena .
2481,3,Then we multiplied these results by the corpus frequency of this particular word and averaged them .
2482,3,An alternative is to allow an unbounded stack to be shared between two ( or more ) daughters but not with the mother .
2483,3,The preceding qualitative discussion provides some indication of what aspects of distributional relationships may be discovered by clustering .
2484,1,The study and the first results we have here presented cover from lexical semantics to discourse structures _comma_ with strong interactions between these two ends .
2485,5,An appealing alternative is grammar-based language models .
2486,7,The following discussion deals only with referential and ascriptive noun phrases as generic noun phrases were discussed in Section  .
2487,3,Evaluation of the generated abstract showed that it contains at maximum 74 % of the most important sentences of the original text .
2488,4,So _comma_ one can compare default handling with advice to the system .
2489,3,Assuming he believes the salience information in table  _comma_ he computes the confidence value of 4 .
2490,1,The question addressed in this paper concerns how we should relate pitch contours to tone sequences .
2491,3,Most of this analysis is fairly orthodox .
2492,5,The simplest part-of-speech taggers are bigram or trigram models Church 1989 _comma_ Charniak et al. 1993 .
2493,3,The span of a grammar rule R is the length of the longest island  such that terminals and are both consumed ( directly or indirectly ) by R .
2494,3,The relations exemplified in Table  are used for representing the rhetorical structure .
2495,5,However _comma_ for the semantic form  _comma_ a decidable variant of higher order unification might be used instead _comma_ in order to include the reduction of - expressions .
2496,5,The principle goal is then to find the maximal parsable subset of the input string ( and its parse ) .
2497,4,Semantic information is expressed in
2498,3,Following the initiative of the other can be seen as an obligation driven process _comma_ while leading the conversation will be goal driven .
2499,3,If nothing else _comma_ the present work has made very clear to us that the interplay of static and dynamic ideas in generative grammar is a delicate and complex matter which only further work can resolve .
2500,3,Efficient Compilation of HPSG Grammars '' of the Sonderforschungsbereich 340 of the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft .
2501,3,determining how to handle underspecifications _comma_ and
2502,3,The ith singular value can be interpreted as indicating the strength of the ith principal component of C.  and are orthonormal matrices that approximate the rows and columns of C _comma_ respectively .
2503,3,The discussion above shows what can be achieved by treating focus as a syntactic marker which makes information available to a variety of operators .
2504,5,where T denotes the set of terminal symbols in the domain .
2505,4,These auxiliary verbs as well as ordinary verbs can dominate some cases so that these agglutinations may change the whole syntax Gunji 1987 .
2506,3,However _comma_ if we are content with being able to plot all categories on a two-dimensional plane _comma_ which probably is what we want to do _comma_ for ease of exposition _comma_ we only use the two first and most significant functions .
2507,3,For the following _comma_ we will focus on CoL verbs ( the Change of Location verbs ) _comma_ mainly because they are rich in spatiotemporal informations _comma_ but also because we have at disposal exhaustive lists of French CoL verbs .
2508,4,In NL analysis _comma_ the syntactic information associated with lexical items makes top-down parsing less attractive than bottom-up ( e.g. CKY ) Kasami 1965 _comma_ Younger 1967 _comma_ although the latter is often augmented with top-down prediction to improve performance Earley 1970 _comma_ Lang 1974 _comma_ Pratt 1975 .
2509,4,says that I didn't borrow any of your other possessions _comma_ says that I didn't borrow anyone else 's car _comma_ and says that I didn't do anything else to your car .
2510,3,For example _comma_ the LOB tagset used 134 tags _comma_ while the Penn treebank tagset has 48 .
2511,5,When  is applied to the predicate _comma_ will result after - reduction .
2512,3,Morphosyntactic issues of broken plurals _comma_ diminutives and deverbal nouns can be handled by a complementary correction strategy which also depends on morphological analysis .
2513,4,That is _comma_ while either of sentences  or can have the purely conjunctive reading _comma_ only sentence can be understood to mean that Hillary 's becoming angry was caused by or came as a result of Bill 's becoming upset .
2514,3,This information can be compiled automatically and also might improve the accuracy of tagging unknown words .
2515,3,Determine a threshold entropy that yields the desired coverage .
2516,3,By employing models that embody the assumption that words belonging to a same cluster occur in the same context with equal likelihood _comma_ our method achieves the smoothing effect as a side effect of the clustering process _comma_ where the domains of smoothing coincide with the clusters obtained by clustering .
2517,3,In addition _comma_ I adopt an an assumption that a chain of reasoning is only as strong as its weakest link :
2518,5,Gerdemann 1991 partly overcame this problem by incorporating a head-driven strategy into Earley 's algorithm .
2519,3,For each word form the lexicon gives the set of POS tags that can be assigned to that word .
2520,3,As the QLF becomes more instantiated _comma_ the set of possible evaluations narrows towards a singleton .
2521,3,There was a total of 450 turns in the dialogues .
2522,4,In dialogues in which both agents are autonomous _comma_ each agent deliberates whether to accept or reject the contributions of the current speaker .
2523,6,The method _comma_ which is related to that of Iyer et al. 1994 _comma_ involves clustering the sentences in the training corpus into a number of subcorpora _comma_ each predicting a different probability distribution for linguistic objects .
2524,5,Heeman and Hirst used plan repair techniques to refashion an expression _comma_ and used discourse plans _comma_ or meta-plans _comma_ to communicate the changes to it .
2525,3,However _comma_ I use theorem  and resolved feature structures to yield a less general interpretation free characterisation of a satisfiable feature structure that admits of such an algorithm .
2526,5,To apply the centering theory that is originally for a sequence of sentences _comma_ namely discourse _comma_ we regard the subordinate clause and the main clause as a segment of discourse respectively .
2527,3,If the listener believes P and either believes that P presents an obstacle to the proposed plan or believes that P is part of the proposed plan that has already been satisfied _comma_ then interrupt ;
2528,3,When the anaphor occurs after one or several unattached prepositions _comma_ it could be an intra-sentential anaphor ( i.e. referring to an entity in the same sentence ) _comma_ then its resolution may depend on one of the previous prepositional phrases .
2529,3,I would like to thank Stuart Shieber _comma_ Barbara Grosz _comma_ Fernando Pereira _comma_ Mary Dalrymple _comma_ Candy Sidner _comma_ Gregory Ward _comma_ Arild Hestvik _comma_ Shalom Lappin _comma_ Christine Nakatani _comma_ Stanley Chen _comma_ Karen Lochbaum _comma_ and two anonymous reviewers for valuable discussions and comments on earlier drafts .
2530,3,Up to now _comma_ we just realized a simple repair strategy that consists of repeating the concerned parts of the utterance _comma_ e.g. `` der Besucher ... h ... dieser Termin wird von dem Besucher gewnscht '' .
2531,3,This procedure is exactly captured by the presentation operator below .
2532,3,In principle _comma_ this rule can be applied to any pair of unit clauses and non-unit clauses of the program to derive any consequences of the program .
2533,3,It abstracts away from specific syntactic realisations .
2534,3,In order to do this a number of subsidiary tasks will be addressed .
2535,5,John gave Mary a book and Peter a paper about subjacency
2536,3,For instance _comma_ superlative adjectives can act as nouns _comma_ so they are initially given the 2 tags : noun or adjective .
2537,3,We wish to select the more appropriate of the two interpretations .
2538,2,For the word sense disambiguation based on the context similarity _comma_ co-occurrence vectors from the 1987 Wall Street Journal ( 20 M total words ) was advantageous over distance vectors from the Collins English Dictionary ( head words + definition words ) .
2539,3,Other words are tagged using suffix information _comma_ or else defaults are invoked .
2540,3,It suggested that this was primarily due to difficulty in encoding a proper notion of syntactic context .
2541,3,We apply a set of rules for the transfer of control to 4 sets of dialogues consisting of a total of 1862 turns .
2542,4,Cycles might emerge to treat unknown sequences of words _comma_ i.e. sentences with unknown parts of unknown lengths Lang 1988 .
2543,3,Apparently _comma_ the 250 most frequent words capture most of the relevant distributional information so that the additional information from less frequent words available from generalized vectors only has a small effect .
2544,3,As for category  _comma_ subjective verbs like `` kurusimu '' ( feel sick ) and `` kanasimu '' ( feel sadness ) that describe subjective and / or emotional experience in verb form _comma_ are used .
2545,5,On a given input sentence _comma_ the parser returns a collection of parses that correspond to maximal _comma_ or close to maximal _comma_ parsable subsets of the original input .
2546,3,Furthermore _comma_ by capturing the negotiation process in a recursive Propose-Evaluate-Modify cycle of actions _comma_ our model can successfully handle embedded negotiation subdialogues .
2547,6,Gerdemann and Goetz 's Troll type resolution system implements both the semantics and an efficient refinement of the satisfiability algorithm I present here Goetz 1993 _comma_ Gerdemann and King 1994 _comma_ Gerdemann forthcoming .
2548,3,Instead of splitting presentation goals into subgoals according to standard schemata _comma_ it follows the local derivation relation to find a next proof node or subproof to be presented .
2549,3,These texts were not seen at the training phase which means that neither the taggers nor the guessers had been trained on these texts and they naturally had words unknown to the lexicon .
2550,3,Recall that the transition between two tones  and also involves the factor .
2551,3,The constants true and false play their usual role _comma_ c-struct and f-struct give us ` labels ' for our two domains _comma_ while the elements of Cat and Atom enable us to talk about syntactic categories and atomic f-structure information respectively .
2552,3,All that prompts such as uh huh do is provide evidence of attention .
2553,4,Collaborative negotiation differs from non-collaborative negotiation and argumentation mainly in the attitude of the participants _comma_ since collaborative agents are not self-centered _comma_ but act in a way as to benefit the agents as a group .
2554,4,To see how this works _comma_ let 's run through a simple example .
2555,5,Sensitivity to native-language phonotactics in 9-month - olds was recently reported by Jusczyk et al. 1993a .
2556,4,This captures the sense in which LIG derivations exhibit `` context-freeness '' .
2557,4,In fact the ( possibly enormously large ) parse forest grammar might define an empty language ( if the intersection was empty ) .
2558,3,For example _comma_ it is a straightforward matter to transform the  -Prolog code into a logic called  Miller 1990 which requires only a restricted form of unification that is decidable in linear time and space .
2559,3,My hypothesis is that this technique produces more consistent volume ( and hence _comma_ pitch scaling ) over long utterances and may make informants less self-conscious about speaking loudly than simply asking them to imagine speaking to subjects at various distances away .
2560,3,Given the representation in Figure  as the source _comma_ the semantics for the missing VP may be recovered in one of two ways .
2561,3,by locating the subject
2562,5,Since there are arbitrarily large numbers of different stack configurations ( the stack can be of arbitrary size ) _comma_ the dynamics for shift reduce parsing involves the use of an infinite number of states .
2563,3,Because  _comma_ is a solution of the equation .
2564,3,The language  is defined as :
2565,3,If one membrane contains only one composite structure _comma_ and it still has surplus valences _comma_ we can regard that whole the membrane has those surplus valences as follows .
2566,3,Proposition 15 .
2567,3,A separate instrumental study supports this hypothesis Bird and Stegen 1993 .
2568,3,Due to the space limitation _comma_ in this paper we mainly pursue the constraints about semantic feature structures .
2569,3,These figures give a positive evaluation of the coverage of WordNet .
2570,3,To compute  and we must have nonzero estimates of whenever necessary for to be defined .
2571,3,If this restriction fails to pick out a unique individual the whole expression is meaningless in the context .
2572,7,Next _comma_ we describe the implementation of the system and the result of the experiment of parsing real sentences .
2573,5,Many approaches focus on exploiting specific knowledge about grammars and / or the computational task ( s ) that one is using them for by making filtering explicit and extending the processing strategy such that this information can be made effective .
2574,2,The learning was performed on the Brown Corpus data and rule-sets _comma_ with a highly competitive performance _comma_ were produced and compared with the state-of-the-art .
2575,3,The first part of the table shows that when the Xerox guesser is applied before the E  guesser we measure a drop in the performance .
2576,3,The basic construction is just the same as in the paradigm structure _comma_ but now we have narrative progression in the consequent box .
2577,5,Each judgment / refashioning pair operates on the current referring expression _comma_ replacing it with a new one .
2578,5,As pointed out already _comma_ Hyman 's is a partial downstep model while Stewart 's is a total downstep model .
2579,3,The pruning process is remarkably effective .
2580,3,COLLABORATIVE PRINCIPLE :
2581,6,The differences in the beliefs and knowledge states of the participants can be interpreted in the terms of the collaborative planning principles of Whittaker and Stenton 1988 .
2582,3,Our model of obligation is very simple .
2583,5,The counted frequencies are taken as an approximation to the model 's probabilities and get smoothed in a small number of training iterations .
2584,3,The substitutions can be built up in an order-independent way ( i.e. before _comma_ after or during scoping ) _comma_ and without recourse to higher-order unification .
2585,3,a limit of proximity distinguishing an outside of proximity from a far away outside ; indeed _comma_ if sortir simply requires to go out of the lref _comma_ partir in addition forces the mobile to go sufficiently far away from that lref .
2586,3,Table  and Figure show some of the characteristics of the corpus .
2587,3,These results are consistent with other findings for such models _comma_ suggesting that the existence or otherwise of an improvement brought about by clustering is indeed a good pointer to whether it is worth developing further the unclustered model .
2588,3,In a recent field trip to Western Cameroon to study the Bamileke Dschang noun associative construction _comma_ I was able to collect a small amount of data relating to F  scaling throughout a particular informant 's pitch range .
2589,3,This is important evidence for the main hypothesis of this paper : that enhancing a language model with clustering _comma_ which once the software is in place can be done largely automatically _comma_ can give us important clues about whether it is worth expending research _comma_ programming _comma_ data-collection and machine resources on hand-coded improvements to the way in which the language model in question models context _comma_ or whether those resources are best devoted to different _comma_ additional kinds of language model .
2590,3,Furthermore we found that not all types of anaphora behaved in the same way .
2591,3,Here _comma_ the internal states are not accessible _comma_ so we can't get interleaving of two coordinations _comma_ as in :
2592,5,There is not space here to present full justification for adopting such an approach or to detail the advantages that it offers .
2593,3,We chose m = 50 ( reduction to a 50-dimensional space ) for the SVD 's described in this paper .
2594,3,The basic grammar provides some spurious derivations _comma_ since sentences such as John likes Mary can be bracketed as either ( ( John likes ) Mary ) or ( John ( likes Mary ) ) .
2595,3,This is in sharp contrast to what the above scheme accomplishes ; the corresponding figures are about 20 or 30 percent each for lengths one and two .
2596,3,Now _comma_ in section  _comma_ we argued that no more than n - 1 rewrites would ever be necessary _comma_ thus the overall complexity of generation ( even when no solution is found ) is .
2597,7,Sections  and discuss these findings and present conclusions .
2598,5,A top-down _comma_ semantic-structure-driven generation algorithm has been defined by Wedekind 1988 which gives a basis for dynamic subgoal-reordering guided by the semantic input .
2599,3,In this corpus _comma_ the chosen nouns appear as direct object heads of a total of 2147 distinct verbs _comma_ so each noun is represented by a density over the 2147 verbs .
2600,5,If B rejects or postpones _comma_ then the expression must be refashioned by either A or B. Refashionings are accomplished in three main ways : repairing the expression by correcting speech errors _comma_ expanding the expression by adding more qualifications _comma_ or replacing part or all of the expression with new qualifications .
2601,3,Further contextual information is required to fill the gaps .
2602,3,The middle ground involves taking the type of object into account when choosing attributes and landmarks that relate to it .
2603,5,The training set is a treebank consisting of implicit parse trees that each specify a verified analysis of an input sentence .
2604,3,Thus a specification language adequate for LFG must be capable of talking about the usual tree relations _comma_ the various features _comma_ and zoomin ; it must also be powerful enough to permit the statement of generalisations ; and it must have some mechanism for regulating the interaction between  and .
2605,4,All of them entail the same basic message _comma_ namely that I borrowed your car .
2606,3,focus is thus very like the standard feature slash which is used for dealing with left extraposition -- it is a foot feature whose value is some item which is somehow `` out of position .
2607,4,Instead _comma_ it would seem that the real contrast driving the shift towards statistics in language processing is a contrast between qualitative systems dealing exclusively with combinatoric constraints _comma_ and quantitative systems that involve computing numerical functions .
2608,5,Propositions are are either believed or not believed _comma_
2609,1,Introducing free-ordered typed  - calculus _comma_ together with the notion of unification costs in types _comma_ we have shown the structuring of natural language syntax _comma_ by distributively represented types in random orders .
2610,5,The incoherence of example  is predicted by both their and our accounts by virtue of the fact that there is no coherence relation that corresponds to Narration with reverse temporal ordering .
2611,3,We have verified the advantages of processing-conforming default handling by implementing a default handler for VM-GEN .
2612,3,In both cases _comma_ many independence assumptions that are known to be at best reasonable approximations will have to be made .
2613,5,LIG _comma_ which were first described by Gazdar 1988 _comma_ are constrained such that stacks are passed from the mother to at most a single daughter .
2614,3,For example _comma_ the preference of structure [ [ 118 _comma_ 311 ] _comma_ 137 ] is calculated as follows :
2615,3,The total number of co-occurrence triples extracted amounts to 190_comma_766 .
2616,3,This was obtained from the meaning postulate by substituting  for B and using .
2617,2,The use of the method and the focus of this work are novel : previous work has focused on determining underlying mechanisms for cooperative strategies rather than on investigating when a strategy is effective .
2618,7,Section  shows applications of the similarity measure -- computing similarity between texts _comma_ and measuring coherence of a text .
2619,3,This comprises the restriction of the antecedent and a new category constructed by taking the features of the antecedent category _comma_ unless overridden by those on the ellipsis -- a kind of ( monotonic ) priority union Grover et al. 1994 except using skeptical as opposed to credulous default unification Carpenter 1993 .
2620,3,The problem is justifying the main / subordinate distinction in every language that we might wish to translate into German .
2621,3,The instantiation ( prediction ) rule of top-down Earley deduction is not needed in bottom-up Earley deduction _comma_ because there is no prediction .
2622,3,The mechanisms we discuss are : the location time _comma_ Rpt and perf .
2623,3,Note that all the geometrical possibilities are not lexicalized in French .
2624,4,Now consider :
2625,3,Any transitions not seen in the training corpus are given a small _comma_ non-zero probability .
2626,3,The similarity-based method yields a 20 % perplexity improvement in the prediction of unseen bigrams and statistically significant reductions in speech-recognition error .
2627,3,Modulo notation _comma_ this definition is identical to the one given earlier for PCFGs .
2628,3,Other mental actions in the intermediate plans add up the confidence values of the attributes _comma_ and a final constraint makes sure that the sum exceeds the agent 's confidence threshold .
2629,5,Haugeneder 's system has very limited coverage .
2630,3,Thus _comma_ I could set the informant 's voice pitch by using the volume control on my radio .
2631,3,If X is a syntactic type _comma_ and L and R are lists of categories _comma_ then  is a category .
2632,5,Due to the beam search heuristic and the ambiguity packing scheme _comma_ this set of parses is limited to maximal or close to maximal grammatical subsets .
2633,3,Such verbs do not behave all homogeneously .
2634,3,Ultimately _comma_ this algorithm is intended to be part of a suite of techniques used for disambiguating words in running text with respect to WordNet senses .
2635,3,This assures that the sentential symbol can expand to every symbol ; otherwise _comma_ adding a symbol will not affect the probabilities that the grammar assigns to strings .
2636,3,If  is rational then for each feature structure F _comma_ F is satisfiable iff F has a resolvant .
2637,3,The English gross of this relation garu is ` observe ' .
2638,3,Data on discovered word types helps make this comparison : DIST-FREE found 12 % of the words with 30 % accuracy and DIST-PHONO found 33 % of the words with 50 % accuracy .
2639,3,If Narration (A_comma_B) then  .
2640,2,Outperforming n-gram models in the first two domains demonstrates that our algorithm is able to take advantage of the grammatical structure present in data .
2641,3,I restrict the inferences that I discuss to those that are
2642,3,_comma_ and
2643,5,The second representation is appropriate if the sentence finishes with a sentential modifier .
2644,3,A larger dictionary in later versions will address this problem .
2645,3,We describe three coherence relations relevant to the examples in this paper and give temporal constraints for them .
2646,2,These studies demonstrated infants ' perceptive abilities without demonstrating the usefulness of infants ' perceptions .
2647,3,The complexity of this phase is therefore the product of the picking and combining complexities _comma_ i.e.  .
2648,4,While a full analysis of a conversation might well take these into account _comma_ for many purposes they represent a significant obstacle to analysis .
2649,3,The tag set used in the implementation is the smaller version of the two tag sets developed jointly by the Universities of Stuttgart and Tbingen _comma_ referred to as the ELWIS tag set Thielen 1994 _comma_ Thielen and Schiller 1995 .
2650,2,In addition _comma_ n-gram models are extremely large _comma_ thus making them difficult to implement efficiently in memory-constrained applications .
2651,3,The expert has control for around 90 % of utterances in the TODs whereas control is shared almost equally in the ADs. Secondly _comma_ contrary to our expectations _comma_ we did find some instances of shifts in the TODs .
2652,5,This schema supports a weak model of mutual beliefs _comma_ that is more akin to mutual assumptions or mutual suppositions Prince 1987 .
2653,5,Traces are associated with assumptions which are subsequently discharged by a suitable construction .
2654,5,These are :
2655,5,Reference networks have been successfully used as neural networks ( by Vronis and Ide 1990 for word sense disambiguation ) and as fields for artificial association _comma_ such as spreading activation ( by Kozima and Furugori 1993 for context-coherence measurement ) .
2656,3,In our ALE implementation _comma_ a DCU contains the following slots for temporal information :
2657,7,The outline of the paper is as follows : in section  we summarize the basic methodology used in Ribas 1994b _comma_ analyzing its limitations ; in section we explore some alternative statistical measures for ranking the hypothesized SRs ; in section we propose some evaluation measures on the SRs-learning problem _comma_ and use them to test the experimental results obtained by the different techniques ; finally _comma_ in section we draw up the final conclusions and establish future lines of research .
2658,2,The ARPA air travel information ( ATIS ) domain is an example .
2659,2,So _comma_ for example _comma_ whether two terms with identical meanings are merely co-referential or are co-indexed is the kind of information that may get lost : the difference amounts to two ways of composing the same meaning .
2660,3,Similarity between words is computed by spreading activation on Paradigme .
2661,2,The current work improves upon that analysis in several respects .
2662,3,This is because in many cases it is impossible to tell from the Japanese form or syntactic shape whether a translated noun phrase will fall within the scope of a denumerator or not .
2663,7,To summarize this section _comma_ we have characterized the forms being addressed according to two features _comma_ a summary of which appears in Table  .
2664,2,In this evaluation we tried two different taggers .
2665,6,Concerning the PPs _comma_ unattached prepositions involve empty or unfilled roles in the Conceptual Structures ( CSs ) _comma_ expressed in a frame-based language Zarri 1992 .
2666,3,However _comma_ this same process of recursive descent via scoped constants will work for any member of the conj rule family .
2667,3,There doesn't seem to be a clear co-relation between Assoc and the manual diagnostic .
2668,5,More recently _comma_ the field of dialectometry _comma_ as introduced by Sguy 1971 _comma_ Sguy 1973 _comma_ has addressed these issues by developing several techniques for summarizing and presenting variation along multiple dimensions .
2669,3,The proof in Figure  is associated with the list : ( _comma_ _comma_ _comma_ ) .
2670,3,This computation would be quite complex _comma_ so we have adopted a middle ground between the simple context-independent approaches _comma_ and a full-blown contextual analysis .
2671,3,We propose to refine this structure with two new concepts _comma_ required to distinguish minimal pairs like sortir ( to go out ) / partir ( to leave ) _comma_ and entrer ( to enter ) / atterir ( to land ) .
2672,5,Some of the most compelling arguments against deletion have been semantic .
2673,7,In Section  _comma_ we categorize elliptical and event referential forms according to two features :
2674,3,Let F be a group _comma_ U be a subgroup of F _comma_ 1 be a unit element of F and  be a unit element of U. According to the definition of unit element _comma_ .
2675,3,coverage - the proportion of words which the guesser was able to classify _comma_ but not necessarily correctly ; .
2676,5,The idea behind this is to create a specialized grammar that retains a high coverage but allows very much faster parsing .
2677,3,I presented instrumental data from Bamileke Dschang and showed how the function could be specialised for this language .
2678,3,and the value of the feature f in  is
2679,5,We mark the path p with a dotted line .
2680,7,This paper is divided into four main sections _comma_ summarised in turn below .
2681,3,Since some words never occur in a corpus _comma_ and thus cannot be reliably classified by a method solely based on corpus data _comma_ we propose to combine the use of an automatically constructed thesaurus and a hand made thesaurus in disambiguation .
2682,5,For example _comma_  is acceptable since the coordination type is NP AP _comma_ and is subcategorises for both NPs and APs .
2683,3,Ignoring the possibility of downstep for the present _comma_ we have a static two-tone system where HH and LL sequences are level and sequences like HLHLHL are realised as simple oscillation between two pitches .
2684,3,I adopt the assumption that the participants in a dialogue are trying to achieve some purpose Grosz and Sidner 1986 .
2685,6,We take a slightly unconventional perspective on feature structures _comma_ because it is easier to cast our theory within the more general framework of incremental description refinement Mellish 1988 than to exploit the usual metaphors of constraint-based grammar .
2686,3,We continue our investigations on two directions :
2687,3,If an elephant is referred to not as an individual elephant but as a source of meat _comma_ then it will be expressed in an uncountable noun phrase : ` I ate a slice of elephant ' .
2688,3,The analysis consists of three steps :
2689,3,For example _comma_ after recognizing the reference in Example  _comma_ the hearer evaluates the plan .
2690,3,How and when agents decide to augment the strength of evidence for a belief has not been addressed in this work as yet .
2691,3,The same procedure can be applied on diminutive and deverbal nouns .
2692,6,We illustrate the relevant syntactic and semantic properties of these forms using the version of Categorial Semantics described in Pereira 1990 .
2693,5,An architecture was presented whereby utterances were parsed into propositional representations which were subsequently integrated into a discourse model .
2694,3,For the second condition to hold _comma_ the hearer must believe that the identification plan is good enough to uniquely identify the referent when it becomes visible .
2695,3,The rhetorical structure is represented by a binary tree on the analogy of a syntactic tree of a natural language sentence .
2696,7,We describe our experimental results in this section .
2697,6,A comprehensive account is given in Lyon 1994 ; descriptions of the neural net process are also in Lyon 1993 and Lyon and Frank 1992 .
2698,4,A higher level of syntactic analysis indicating the phrasal structure would be required to predict which tag is correct _comma_ and this information is not available to fixed-context taggers .
2699,3,However _comma_ the initial processing stages _comma_ in which the problem size is constrained _comma_ operate within a skeletal grammatic framework .
2700,3,As future work _comma_ we will extend the default preconditions towards handling complex contextual information .
2701,3,Thus the number n of the random variables is roughly equal to the number of prepositions in English ( and less than 100 ) .
2702,3,To determine the relationship between the derived control segments and ATTENTIONAL STATE we looked at the distribution of anaphora with respect to the control segments in the ADs .
2703,5,Sag and Hankamer 1984 note that while elliptical sentences such as are unacceptable because of a voice mismatch _comma_ similar examples with non-elided event referential forms such as do it are much more acceptable :
2704,4,This behaviour of a generator is motivated by psycholinguistic observations which show that people start speaking before all necessary linguistic material has been chosen ( e.g. _comma_ articulating a noun phrase before the dominating verb is selected ) .
2705,5,If T is a partial phrase marker _comma_ and T ' is a partial phrase marker which differs from it only in that a single non-terminal node  in T has been expanded to in T ' _comma_ then .
2706,3,The remaining 121_comma_966 triples were processed through the lemmatizer .
2707,4,One obvious solution to this problem would be to extend distributional grouping methods to word senses .
2708,3,Once such a set of conditions is met _comma_ the corresponding inference is drawn _comma_ but it is assigned a defeasible status .
2709,3,Evaluating SPATTER against the Penn Treebank Wall Street Journal corpus using the PARSEVAL measures _comma_ SPATTER achieves 86 % precision _comma_ 86 % recall _comma_ and 1.3 crossing brackets per sentence for sentences of 40 words or less _comma_ and 91 % precision _comma_ 90 % recall _comma_ and 0.5 crossing brackets for sentences between 10 and 20 words in length .
2710,3,The two rules _comma_ which are given in Figure  _comma_ are difficult to understand in their most general form .
2711,3,They must first be discharged by the scoping rule _comma_ which substitutes the terms and indices by  - bound variables .
2712,3,Those observations are summarised below .
2713,3,In passage  _comma_ both the tense and the coherence relation order the times in backward progression .
2714,3,Incidentally _comma_  is essentially a piece of syntactic sugar ; it could be replaced by a collection of unary modalities Blackburn and Meyer-Viol 1994 .
2715,2,Also _comma_ since only relationships between successive sentences were considered _comma_ the scope which the relationships cover cannot be analyzed _comma_ even if explicit connectives are detected .
2716,3,This allows very much faster parsing and gives a lower error rate _comma_ at the price of a small loss in coverage .
2717,4,For example _comma_ we can drive a rule VP  vb NP comma rb comma PP from the following sentence .
2718,3,The current approach accounts for these cases .
2719,3,The process of determining the referentiality of a noun phrase is shown in Figure  .
2720,3,A Warrant IRU such as that in  suggests that B 's cognitive limitations may be a factor in what A chooses to say _comma_ so that even if B knows a warrant for adopting A 's proposal _comma_ what is critical is whether the warrant is salient for B _comma_ i.e. whether the warrant is already accessible in B 's working memory Prince 1981 _comma_ Baddeley 1986 .
2721,3,We also evaluated our method by conducting pp-attachment disambiguation experiments using a thesaurus automatically constructed by it and found that disambiguation results can be improved .
2722,5,The method used is to introduce spurious bindings that subsequently get removed .
2723,2,Though Gerdemann 1991 showed how to modify the restriction function to make top-down information available for the bottom-up completion step _comma_ Earley generation with top-down prediction still has a problem in that generating the subparts of a construction in the wrong order might lead to massive nondeterminacy or even nontermination .
2724,3,This is tantamount to demanding the validity of the following formula :
2725,3,recall - the percentage of POS s which were assigned correctly by the guesser to a word ; .
2726,2,As such _comma_ the existential quantification in  has to be stipulated _comma_ whereas our analysis acquires this existential quantification ` for free ' .
2727,2,Yet many systems _comma_ for good practical reasons _comma_ employ this kind of architecture .
2728,3,From propositions  and
2729,3,If  is rational and computable then for some effective function _comma_ for each feature structure F _comma_ if F is satisfiable then ` true otherwise ` false ' .
2730,3,We formalize with 11 axioms in a non-monotonic first order logic the behaviour of all possible kinds of verb-preposition association for the French language .
2731,3,Probabilities are assigned by the following inductive definition :
2732,3,The lexicon lists _comma_ for each word _comma_ all of tags seen in the training corpus with their probabilities .
2733,1,Do bottom-up or top-down techniques work best ?
2734,2,As noted by Dahl and McCord _comma_ this mechanism means that SYSCONJ inherits the problems of nonsensical semantics which plague the deletion accounts _comma_ since John and Mary are alike is treated the same as John are alike and Mary are alike .
2735,3,In particular _comma_ it may be possible to augment our approach with an explicit operational semantics _comma_ perhaps the evolving algebra approach adopted by Moss and Johnson 1994 .
2736,3,Temporal expressions such as at noon and the previous Thursday can have a similar effect : they too can override the default temporal relations and place constraints on tense
2737,5,These already-known warrants are a type of INFORMATIONALLY REDUNDANT UTTERANCE _comma_ henceforth IRU _comma_ which are surprisingly frequent in naturally-occurring dialogue Walker 1993 .
2738,3,A chart is kept of successes and failures of rules _comma_ both to improve efficiency and to provide a means of identifying unattached constituents .
2739,3,We simply replace the usual string positions with the names of the states in the FSA .
2740,3,The patterns are summarised in table  _comma_ each entry in the table showing the patterns for the two tests under the given conditions .
2741,2,Unlike most research in pragmatics that focuses on certain types of presuppositions or implicatures _comma_ we provide a global framework in which one can express all these types of pragmatic inferences .
2742,5,Design-World agents can be parametrized as to discourse strategy _comma_ and the effects of this strategy can be measured against a range of cognitive and task parameters .
2743,3,This says that this form of negation holds between P and Q if Q does not hold of P _comma_ but does hold for some other entity P ' .
2744,4,If it was possible to represent roughly the SRs of the word being studied _comma_ it could be possible to classify roughly the concordances automatically in the different word uses before the lexicographer analysis .
2745,3,The assumptions are that A and B were copresent _comma_ that B was attending to the utterance event _comma_ that B heard the utterance _comma_ and that B believes that the utterance u realizes the intended meaning p .
2746,5,Centering assumes that discourse understanding requires some notion of `` aboutness .
2747,2,While we know of previous work which associates scores with feature structures Kim 1994 are not aware of any previous treatment which makes explicit the link to classical probability theory .

2749,5,indicates to everyone in P that everyone in P has reason to believe that holds .
2750,3,I showed that it is desirable for phonologists working on tone to use sequences of F  values as their primary data _comma_ rather than impressionistic transcriptions which make ( usually implicit ) assumptions about F scaling .
2751,4,Many European languages are of the inflecting type _comma_ and occupy still another region of the space of difficulty .
2752,4,Note in passing that this may not as serious a problem as it first appears .
2753,3,An ` evaluation ' procedure based on Lewin 1992 _comma_ which takes a logical form containing free variables ( such as the w in the LF above ) _comma_ and evaluates it using a dynamic semantics in the context given by the preceding sentences .
2754,3,While the proposed algorithm is not successful for all grammatical categories _comma_ it does show that fully automatic tagging is possible when demands on accuracy are modest .
2755,3,Suppose we want to capture the meaning of rule  of Figure _comma_ repeated here for convenience :
2756,1,Therefore _comma_ we propose the following extension which handles some additional cases containing multiple ambiguous pronouns : we have extended rule 2 so that there are two kinds of shifts .
2757,3,In LFG _comma_ this applies to a ( small ) finite number of attributes ( that is _comma_ transitions in the feature structure ) .
2758,5,If B is a ` helpful ' agent ( nonautonomous ) _comma_ B will accept A 's proposal without a warrant .
2759,3,These tests gave an early peak _comma_ but the graphs of accuracy against number of iterations show the pattern to be classical rather than early maximum .
2760,1,We study the computational complexity of the parsing problem of a variant of Lambek Categorial Grammar that we call semidirectional .
2761,5,de Swart 1991 gives this example to illustrate the inability to interpret temporal connectives without the use of the reference times .
2762,5,It is easy to see that the number of parameters in a dendroid distribution is of the order  _comma_ where k is the maximum of all _comma_ and n is the number of random variables _comma_ and the time complexity of the algorithm is of the order .
2763,3,hypotheses for correction of string errors which should be delayed Erbach 1993 .
2764,4,Tagging by means of a Hidden Markov Model ( HMM ) is widely recognised as an effective technique for assigning parts of speech to a corpus in a robust and efficient manner .
2765,3,The obligations encode learned social norms _comma_ and guide each agent 's behavior without the need for intention recognition or the use of shared plans at the discourse level .
2766,3,According to this axiom _comma_ if a set of paths G has meaning X _comma_ then for each R-relation  that has been introduced _comma_ a resource can be produced .
2767,3,We have argued that obligations play an important role in accounting for the interactions in dialog .
2768,5,Gerdemann 1991 tackled this shortcoming by modifying the restriction function to make top-down information available for the bottom-up completion step .
2769,3,Thirdly _comma_ LFG grammars impose constraints on zoomin .
2770,3,Firstly we define  .
2771,3,present  ( subgoal 2 ) a PCA with the verbalization : `` Next _comma_ we consider the second case by assuming G . ''
2772,4,However _comma_ in complex sentences _comma_ things are quite different .
2773,3,In any specific application area it will be unlikely that the text database to be accessed will be completely free form .
2774,3,Definition 20 .
2775,2,This result challenges the claims of recent discourse theories Grosz and Sidner 1986 _comma_ Reichman 1985 which argue for a the close relation between cue words and discourse structure .
2776,3,A further conclusion might be that when a corpus is being tagged by hand _comma_ a large tagset should be used _comma_ since it can always be reduced to a smaller one if the application demands it .
2777,3,( Note that a hand made thesaurus is based on hard clustering . )
2778,3,In  _comma_ X _comma_ G and G ' are literals _comma_ is a ( possibly empty ) sequence of literals _comma_ and is the most general unifier of G and G ' .
2779,3,However _comma_ we also show that the termination properties change drastically : we show that it is undecidable whether the intersection of a FSA and a DCG is empty ( even if the DCG is off-line parsable ) .
2780,1,As a noun phrase 's countability in English is affected by its referential property ( generic _comma_ referential or ascriptive ) we present a method of determining the referential use of Japanese noun phrases .
2781,3,We found that it is better to smooth  by interpolating it with the unigram probability ( recall that Katz used as ) .
2782,3,inherent lexical sensitivity of dependency representations _comma_ facilitating parameter estimation ;
2783,3,In each category of  _comma_ _comma_ _comma_ and _comma_ exists there a person who is affected by the situation described by the subordinate clause .
2784,3,This can never exceed the number of interior nodes of the TNCB formed from n lexical signs ( i.e. n - 2 ) .
2785,3,Finally _comma_ we observe that for this reduction the rules  and are again irrelevant and that we can extend this result to .
2786,3,zetumetu `` die out '' _comma_ is entered in the lexicon as a verb whose subject must be generic .
2787,3,Change of position verbs ( voyager-to travel ; courir-to run ) denote a change of position .
2788,3,After the sentences to be included in the abstract are determined _comma_ the system alternately arranges the sentences and the connectives from which the relations were extracted _comma_ and realizes the text of the abstract .
2789,3,In short _comma_ we have captured the effect of an annotated rule purely declaratively .
2790,3,The candidate disambiguators are the words in the sentence _comma_ relationships among the words _comma_ and relationships among constituents already constructed in the parsing process .
2791,2,Finally _comma_ the current approach more readily scales up to more complex cases .
2792,5,Continuing is preferred over retaining which is preferred over shifting .
2793,3,These functions can then be used to predict the category memberships of new individuals based on their parameter scores Tatsuoka 1971 _comma_ Mustonen 1965 .
2794,3,I am grateful to Manny Rayner and anonymous European ACL referees for commenting on earlier versions of this paper _comma_ and to Pierrette Bouillion and Magorzata Sty for comments and also for providing me with their analyses of the French and Polish examples respectively .
2795,5,They argued that in the library dialogues they analyzed _comma_ `` in no cases does negotiation extend beyond the initial belief conflict and its immediate resolution . '' Logan et al. 1994 .
2796,3,In particular _comma_ they can have arguments _comma_ and may therefore be used to assign a structure to unidentified input so that it may be flagged as such within an overall parse .
2797,3,Concerning downstep _comma_ I shall assume that the magnitude of downstep is independent of the tones on either side _comma_ and so  .
2798,2,The first problem _comma_ as Gaston Paris noted Durand 1889 _comma_ is that isoglosses rarely coincide .
2799,3,allowing for underlying assumptions _comma_
2800,3,For our purposes _comma_ a probabilistic type hierarchy ( PTH ) is a four-tuple
2801,3,The first step in constraining the problem size is to partition an unlimited vocabulary into a restricted number of part-of-speech tags .
2802,2,The kind of biasing Cutting et al. describe reflects linguistic insights combined with an understanding of the predictions a tagger could reasonably be expected to make and the ones it could not .
2803,3,The first condition _comma_ originally described by Appelt 1985b _comma_ is important because the success of the referring action depends on the hearer formulating a useful identification plan .
2804,4,A drawback of the pure Lambek Calculus L is that it only allows for so-called ` peripheral extraction ' _comma_ i.e. _comma_ in our example the trace should better be initial or final in the relative clause .
2805,6,The net that gave best results was a simple single layer net ( Figure  ) _comma_ derived from the Hodyne net of Wyard and Nightingale 1990 .
2806,5,Several approaches have been suggested to account for this behavior .
2807,6,Of course our research is based on their works and observations .
2808,3,As previously mentioned _comma_ LHIP facilitates a cyclic approach to grammar development .
2809,3,There were a total of 96 such disagreements .
2810,3,Like the case of garu _comma_ an observer who observers the experience can be introduced .
2811,3,In unification-based grammar _comma_ the feature structure associated with the root of the tree is often regarded as the structure that has been derived from the input ( i.e. _comma_ the output of a parser ) .
2812,3,The presented research was sponsored by Teilprojekt B 4 `` From Constraints to Rules :
2813,3,closed-class vs. adverb ( by _comma_ about _comma_ below ) _comma_
2814,5,In addition _comma_ although Merialdo does not highlight the point _comma_ BW re-estimation starting from less than 5000 words of hand-tagged text shows early maximum behaviour .
2815,6,We can now specify a Partee and Rooth style processing strategy _comma_ which is to prefer readings which require the least use of QNP duplication .
2816,5,The only real difference is that Bar-Hillel allowed arguments to themselves be functions .
2817,3,An agent 's prior beliefs _comma_ preferences and goals cannot be ascertained by direct inspection .
2818,3,Of course _comma_ the author is responsible for all remaining errors .
2819,3,From this scoring _comma_ two values were computed :
2820,4,This task is trivial for languages such as English _comma_ where words are separated by spaces .
2821,3,Select a random ordering of the training corpus _comma_ and initialize each cluster  _comma_ to contain just the kth sentence in the ordering .
2822,3,An application to information retrieval is discussed .
2823,3,For each interpretation I _comma_ each object u in I and each feature structure F _comma_ F is true of u under I iff F approximates the abstraction of u under I .
2824,3,This single attribute was enough to exceed her confidence threshold .
2825,5,By assigning a probability distribution to the possible choices _comma_ decision trees provide a ranking system which not only specifies the order of preference for the possible choices _comma_ but also gives a measure of the relative likelihood that each choice is the one which should be selected .
2826,3,The latter simulates how the next intermediate conclusion to be presented is chosen under the guidance of the local focus .
2827,2,The results of the evaluation are extremely encouraging _comma_ especially considering that disambiguating word senses to the level of fine-grainedness found in WordNet is quite a bit more difficult than disambiguation to the level of homographs Hearst 1991 _comma_ Cowie et al. 1992 .
2828,3,It is not realistic _comma_ however _comma_ to collect all word collocations .
2829,3,For practical NL applications _comma_ it is desirable to have a best-first search strategy _comma_ which follows the most promising paths in the search space first _comma_ and finds preferred solutions before the less preferred ones .
2830,3,The remaining 4 % require knowledge from outside the sentence being translated .
2831,4,However _comma_ on the long run _comma_ the tree notation suggests a more general relation _comma_ e.g. more internal structure or additional _comma_ terminal leaf nodes in the local syntax tree .
2832,3,The structure of Paradigme represents the knowledge system of English _comma_ and an activated state produced on it represents word meaning .
2833,3,We then try to find a modification to the hypothesis grammar _comma_ such as the addition of a grammar rule _comma_ that results in a grammar with a higher score on the objective function .
2834,3,The actual formalism used was much fuller than the rather schematic one given above _comma_ including many additional features such as case _comma_ tense _comma_ person and number .
2835,3,The similarity between words is a mapping  : _comma_ where L is a set of words ( or lexicon ) .
2836,3,The corpus results are better because the training technique explicitly targeted the rule-sets to the most frequent cases of the corpus rather than the lexicon .
2837,3,This is relatively trivial using a non-curried notation similar to that used for AACG .
2838,3,The notation  denotes a set of possible consonants represented by the variable A _comma_ which also occurs on the right hand side of the rule _comma_ indicating that the same selection must be made for both occurrences .
2839,4,Each of the final proper substrings of the sentence ( i.e. some books _comma_ Mary some books etc. ) can be used as a conjunct e.g.
2840,3,Also the sixth sentence is the concluding sentence for the first five .
2841,3,The combined complexity of the test-rewrite cycle is thus  .
2842,5,Biber 1993 applies factor analysis to collocations of two target words ( `` certain '' and `` right '' ) with their immediate neighbors .
2843,1,Our novel generation algorithm has polynomial complexity (  ) .
2844,6,This test-grammar is based on the implementation of an analysis of partial VP topicalization in German Hinrichs et al. 1994 in the Troll system Gerdemann and King 1994 .
2845,3,Within a given cluster _comma_ we assume that each element is generated with equal probability _comma_ i.e. _comma_
2846,3,We evaluate the generality of this analysis by applying the control rules to 4 sets of dialogues _comma_ including both advisory dialogues ( ADs ) and task-oriented dialogues ( TODs ) .
2847,3,TEMPFOC : The most recent event in the current thread which a subsequent eventuality may elaborate upon ( same-event ) _comma_ overlap _comma_ come just_after or precede .
2848,5,This definition of shifting does not consider whether the Cb of  and the Cp of are equal .
2849,3,We compared the best sentence hypothesis in each original lattice and in the modified one _comma_ and counted the word disagreements in which one of the hypotheses is correct .
2850,3,Therefore _comma_ we are interested in methods that only generate a small subset of this ; e.g. if the intersection is empty we want an empty parse-forest grammar .
2851,3,A given ending may point to various categories _comma_ e.g. er identifies not only infinitive verbs but also nouns _comma_ due to possible borrowings from English .
2852,2,From a practical perspective _comma_ there is ample evidence that limited mixed-initiative has contributed to lack of system usability .
2853,3,On the other hand _comma_ no matter how the SL and TL structures differ _comma_ the algorithm will still operate correctly with polynomial complexity .
2854,3,Participants used certain types of signals when discourse goals were proceeding successfully but resorted to interruptions when they were not .
2855,5,The types of evidence considered are categorized and ordered based on the source of the evidence : hypothesis < default < inference < linguistic < physical Clark and Marshall 1981 _comma_ Galliers 1991 ) .
2856,4,Some words _comma_ word sequences _comma_ syntactic constructions and semantic structures are more likely to occur than others _comma_ and the presence of more likely objects in a sentence hypothesis is evidence for the correctness of that hypothesis .
2857,5,Reference markers also carry information about agreement and grammatical function .
2858,3,However _comma_ comparing the average performances of simulations is also useful .
2859,4,The most outstanding of these benefits is probably the fact that the specific way _comma_ how the complete grammar is encoded _comma_ namely in terms of ` combinatory potentials ' of its words _comma_ gives us at the same time recipes for the construction of meanings _comma_ once the words have been combined with others to form larger linguistic entities .
2860,3,This will produce the correct answer in the test phase of generation without the need to rewrite at all .
2861,1,Our aim will be to provide an overall model for translation with the best of both worlds .
2862,3,The computational process is divided in three stages :
2863,4,Extragrammatical sentences include patently ungrammatical constructions as well as utterances that may be grammatically acceptable but are beyond the syntactic coverage of a parser _comma_ and any other difficult ones that are encountered in parsing Carbonell and Hayes 1983 .
2864,3,is an interpretation .
2865,1,In order to take steps towards establishing a methodology for doing this type of comparison _comma_ we conducted a case study .
2866,5,On the other hand _comma_ SRs are generalized to new examples not present in the training set .
2867,3,This dataflow analysis takes as input a specification of the paths of the start category that are considered fully instantiated .
2868,3,R is a resolved feature structure iff [ R is a feature structure  _comma_
2869,3,This involves giving enough information by using the most salient attributes of the referent .
2870,3,For words which failed to be guessed by the guessing rules we applied the standard method of classifying them as common nouns ( NN ) if they are not capitalised inside a sentence and proper nouns ( NP ) otherwise .
2871,5,Given an off-line optimization of the order in which the right-hand side categories in the rules of a logic grammar are processed Minnen et al. 1996 the resulting processing behavior can be considered a generalization of the head corner generation approach Shieber et al. 1990 .
2872,5,These propositions are known as the COMMON GROUND Lewis 1969 _comma_ Grice 1967 .
2873,7,In this section _comma_ we introduce such a representation of LFG ontology .
2874,3,Three complementary sets of word-guessing rules are induced from the lexicon and a raw corpus : prefix morphological rules _comma_ suffix morphological rules and ending-guessing rules .
2875,3,To upgrade this robust parser we proposed heuristics through the analysis on the Penn treebank corpus .
2876,7,Section  describes three unification-based parsers which are related to polynomial-complexity bottom-up CF parsing algorithms .
2877,2,This approach does not address the fundamental issue of the tradeoff between the descriptive capacity of a formalism and its computational power .
2878,5,One of them corresponds to VP _comma_ the other corresponds to VP + a certain kind of subject which is called `` objective subject '' .
2879,3,Rhetorical structure extraction consists of six major sub-processes :
2880,7,Thereafter we introduce the ChAM model and we reinterpret the model in terms of natural language processings .
2881,3,Considering the first of these points _comma_ namely a close relation to a simple probabilistic model _comma_ a good place to start the search might be with a right-branching finite-state grammar .
2882,5,Thus _comma_ though  is computationally expensive _comma_ Troll uses only during compilation _comma_ never during run time .
2883,3,If the configuration in question includes only two words _comma_ such as P(object
2884,3,focus behaves like a GPSG FOOT FEATURE _comma_ in that at most one daughter of an item can have a non-vacuous value for focus _comma_ and that if an item does have exactly one daughter with a non-vacuous value for this feature then the item will share this value with that daughter .
2885,4,Consider the goal of adding a discourse component to a system _comma_ or evaluating and improving one that is already in place .
2886,2,The main point of the present paper is to show that such detours are unnecessary .
2887,3,Henceforth _comma_ I tacitly work with a signature  .
2888,3,Notice also that if  for all x and if then .
2889,3,The authors would like to thank Louis des Tombe and Dominique Estival for comments on earlier versions of this paper .
2890,3,In the absence of an NL system _comma_ SPATTER can be evaluated by comparing its top-ranking parse with the treebank analysis for each test sentence .
2891,3,The outcome of the two experiments together points to heuristics for making effective use of training and re-estimation _comma_ together with some directions for further research .
2892,5,The three parsers in this study are : a bottom-up left-corner parser _comma_ a ( non-deterministic ) LR parser _comma_ and an LR-like parser based on an algorithm devised by Schabes 1991 .
2893,3,This suggests _comma_ though further investigation is required _comma_ that distance vectors contain some different semantic information from co-occurrence vectors .
2894,1,This paper describes LHIP ( Left-Head corner Island Parser ) _comma_ a parser designed for broad-coverage handling of unrestricted text .
2895,3,in the above _comma_ Gibson et al. have manipulated number agreement to force low _comma_ middle and high attachment of the bracketed relative clause .
2896,3,for each  _comma_ each and each _comma_ [ [ if runs to q ' in F _comma_ and runs to q ' in F then is defined _comma_ is defined _comma_ _comma_ and
2897,3,If X is a syntactic type ( e.g. s _comma_ np ) _comma_ then  is a category .
2898,3,This can be done in several ways ; one that has been tested is to select for each rule the RHS phrase with the least entropy _comma_ and prescribe that if a node corresponding to the LHS of the rule is chosen as a cutnode _comma_ then no node corresponding to this RHS phrase may be chosen as a cutnode _comma_ and vice versa .
2899,3,the region of the input to be searched for the conjunction clause is the same as that for the rule 's LHS ( B-C ) : its island extends from O to P and covers Q items ;
2900,7,whether the form is anaphoric in the semantics .
2901,1,Our technique segments continuous speech into words using only distributional and phonotactic information more effectively than one might expect -- up to 66 % recall of segmentation points with 92 % accuracy on one sample _comma_ which yields 58 % recall of word types with 67 % accuracy ( the relatively low type accuracy is mitigated by the fact that most incorrect words are meaningful concatenations of correct words -- e.g. _comma_ ` thekitty ' ) .
2902,3,This would seem to be troublesome for our approach _comma_ which uses the location time of the event in the main clause _comma_ and not its reference time .
2903,5,Perhaps past researchers have used inferior bottom-up techniques simply because the necessary algorithms are computationally more tractable .
2904,2,Transformation-based tagging as introduced by Brill 1993 also requires a hand-tagged text for training .
2905,3,where the intuitive reading is the following :  _comma_ that is zero subject _comma_ refers to Taro _comma_ and _comma_ that is not the zero subject _comma_ refers to Taro 's parents who are the observer and motivated of the subordinate clause .
2906,3,By combining a stack decoder search with a breadth-first algorithm with probabilistic pruning _comma_ it is possible to identify the highest-probability parse for any sentence using a reasonable amount of memory and time .
2907,3,Detailed guidelines on the use of the individual tags are available in Thielen and Sailer 1994 .
2908,3,accuracy _comma_ the percent of the hypothesized segmentation points that were actually correct .
2909,3,In the following example _comma_ Joe in  makes a statement that provides propositional content that conflicts with Harry 's statement in and thus provides evidence of non-acceptance .
2910,5,The tree-cutting criteria can be local ( `` The LHS of the original grammar rule is an NP _comma_ '' ) or dependent on the rest of the parse tree ( `` that doesn't dominate the empty string only _comma_ '' ) and previous choices of nodes to cut at ( `` and there is no cut above the current node that is also labelled NP. '' ) .
2911,3,What we show is that this sort of technique can be used to determine which parameters to use _comma_ given a set of them .
2912,5,The main claim it makes is that effective language processing requires a consideration of both the structural and statistical aspects of language _comma_ whereas traditional competence grammars rely only on the former _comma_ and standard statistical techniques such as n-gram models only on the latter .
2913,3,Notice that even if each module is called several times _comma_ there is no redundancy in the processing .
2914,3,Thus there are fewer attempts by the instructor to coordinate activity _comma_ such as by using summaries to synchronize mutual beliefs .
2915,3,It is the difference in their beliefs that leads to the necessity for collaboration on reference .
2916,3,These plots summarize the results of 1800 simulated dialogues : 100 for each AWM setting for each strategy .
2917,3,In case of generation _comma_ this means that the user annotates the path specifying the logical form _comma_ i.e. _comma_ the path ( or some of its subpaths ) _comma_ as bound .
2918,3,has a corresponding Japanese equivalent  :
2919,6,Since many of the random variables ( case slots ) in case frame patterns are essentially independent _comma_ this feature is crucial in our context _comma_ and we thus employ Suzuki 's algorithm for learning our case frame patterns .
2920,7,In this section we outline the main ideas underlying a polynomial time recognition algorithm for PLPATR that generalizes the CKY algorithm Kasami 1965 _comma_ Younger 1967 .
2921,3,Hence the complete sequent to solve is :
2922,2,In particular _comma_ we have compared the performance of employing an MDL-based simulated annealing against that of one based on MLE in word clustering .
2923,3,In case of contradictions the default and all default-caused decisions are revised ( see below ) .
2924,1,This paper gives a syntactic-head-driven generation algorithm which includes a well-defined treatment of moved constituents .
2925,5,For example _comma_ if sets of possible referents for a definite noun phrase are highlighted during word by word processing then the user knows how much or how little information is required for successful reference .
2926,3,Let us consider an example `` SinGataKansetuZei '' .
2927,3,In German most of the effort is going into subclassification within major word classes _comma_ while in English and French a good deal of disambiguation work is devoted to separate major word classes .
2928,3,Let  and
2929,4,However if there can be relations between every pair of semantic roles _comma_ the amount of computation to identify the relations that hold in the given sentence is extremely large .
2930,3,In the dialogue below between Harry ( h ) and Ruth ( r ) _comma_ Ruth in  _comma_ first ensures that she understood Harry correctly _comma_ and then provides explicit evidence of non-acceptance in _comma_ based on her autonomous preferences about how her money is invested .
2931,3,This is not problematic as long as this nondeterminism will eventually disappear _comma_ e.g. _comma_ by combining these solutions with the solutions to cat_3 .
2932,3,When this is so _comma_ the antecedent and ellipsis categories are both used to determine what should be substituted for the antecedent .
2933,3,These concepts are :
2934,3,Search Strategy :
2935,3,In Table  _comma_ we display a sample of the number of parameters and execution time ( on a Decstation 5000 / 33 ) associated with each algorithm .
2936,4,SRs may help a parser to prefer some parses among several grammatical ones Whittemore et al. 1990 .

2938,6,PROVERB adopts a reconstructive approach : Once a proof in a machine oriented formalism is generated in the proof development environment  - MKRP _comma_ a new proof that more resembles those found in mathematical textbooks is reconstructed Huang 1994a .
2939,3,Definition 16 .
2940,3,I provided an F  prediction function which estimated the F value of a tone _comma_ given the F value of the previous tone and the identities of the two tones .
2941,5,`` Theories that analyse the distinction between the simple past and pluperfect purely in terms of different relations between reference times and event times _comma_ rather than in terms of event-connections _comma_ fail to explain why  is acceptable but is awkward .

2942,3,Here  is the set of nodes in that should be removed to avoid violating the constraints on neighbouring cutnodes .
2943,4,There are two principal sources for the parameters of the model .
2944,6,We adopted a model of Chemical Abstract Machine for the partial / concurrent computation model .
2945,3,deny the suggestion with s-deny _comma_ and inform the other by s-actions as to how the plan was expanded .
2946,5,The rule ( lex ) restricts the selection of lexical entries to those which can be ` linked ' to the local goal category ( visualized by a dotted line ) .
2947,2,This correlates closely with the much more laborious technique of determining and counting isoglosses _comma_ and is more accurate than the more familiar metric of computing Hamming distance based on whether vocabulary entries match .
2948,3,This information must be exchanged _comma_ so that the mutual beliefs necessary to develop the collaborative plan are established in the conversation Joshi 1982 .
2949,3,The system generates the abstract of each section of the document by examining its rhetorical structure .
2950,6,For the problem with multi-sentence discourses _comma_ and the `` threads '' that sentences continue _comma_ we use an implementation of temporal centering Kameyama et al. 1993 _comma_ Poesio 1994 .
2951,3,The complexity of the test phase is the number of evaluations that have to be made .
2952,3,In the case of the LeftNucleus relations _comma_ the situation is vice versa .
2953,3,There is a wide range of heterogeneous syntactic functions of cardinals in particular contexts : quantificational and adnominal uses _comma_ bare NP 's ( `` is one of '' ) _comma_ dates and ages ( `` Jan 1 '' _comma_ `` gave his age as 25 '' ) _comma_ and enumerations .
2954,3,This involved two major operations :
2955,1,A simple method for categorizing texts into pre-determined text genre categories using the statistical standard technique of discriminant analysis is demonstrated with application to the Brown corpus .
2956,3,The old version recognizes that a denumerated noun phrase headed by an uncountable noun tofu requires a classifier but does not generate the correct structure neither does it generate a classifier for the pluralia tanta scissors .
2957,3,one or more RHS clauses may be nominated as heads ;
2958,3,Now consider the first transition .
2959,5,Dependence on Dictionaries
2960,3,In the case of ellipsis _comma_ this extra layer of descriptive indirection permits an equational treatment of ellipsis that
2961,3,Subsumption encodes a relationship between the denotations of species and types : object u is in the denotation of type  iff .
2962,3,we discover ways we can improve current theories .
2963,3,Suppose that we have the derived tree shown in Figure  where the nodes at the root of the subtrees and are the so-called f-terminator and g-terminator of the tree 's root _comma_ respectively .
2964,3,For the eventive second sentence of  to be an elaboration of the first sentence _comma_ it must occur in a stative form -- for example as a progressive ( i.e. _comma_ She was building a dog house ) .
2965,3,However _comma_ for the following reasons we believe that this does not constitute as great a limitation as it might appear .
2966,5,The two linguistically closest sites are grouped into one dialect _comma_ and thenceforth treated as a unit .
2967,3,For example _comma_ each transition type can be augmented with a feature ( +/ - ) denoting whether or not that transition has been iterated .
2968,3,Furthermore _comma_ the value of the feature g in  must be b _comma_ whereas _comma_ the feature f is not fixed .
2969,3,In average ending-guessing rules were detected to cover over 96 % of the unknown words .
2970,5,This categorization indicates how freely the content of clause interacts with the outside of clause .
2971,3,The precise grammaticality predictions made by the dynamic approach depend upon the characterisation of the states _comma_ and hence depend on the particular parsing strategy which is specified by the dynamics .
2972,3,It could be the case such procedural residues as  are simply an artifact of using the wrong tools for talking about models .
2973,3,Initial symbol biases are an additional set of biases used to define preferences for tag assignment given a particular equivalence class .
2974,4,Deciding this is a problem even for humans translating from Japanese to English _comma_ but they have their own knowledge of both languages to draw on .
2975,4,( The former approach is called ` divisive _comma_ ' the latter ` agglomerative ' )
2976,3,As an upper bound _comma_ Judge 1 was correct on 68.6 % of those test instances .
2977,3,However there are some general predictions which can be made .
2978,3,The semantics of a motion complex is not the simple addition of the semantics of its constituents .
2979,3,T1 All transition probabilities have the same value .
2980,5,This is actually a schema for a family of rules _comma_ collectively called `` generalized coordination '' _comma_ since the semantic rule is different for each case .
2981,3,For the case  _comma_ the possible tructures are [ [ 118 _comma_ 311 ] _comma_ 137 ] and [ 118 _comma_ [ 311 _comma_ 137 ] ] .
2982,3,Even so _comma_ the scheme described this far is not totally successful _comma_ the performance is not as good as using hand-coded tree-cutting criteria .
2983,3,What should be done ?
2984,5,In a previous paper Kehler 1993b _comma_ five contexts for VP-ellipsis were examined to determine whether the representations retrieved are syntactic or semantic in nature .
2985,3,I is an interpretation  _comma_
2986,5,The interaction of centering with global focusing mechanisms and with other factors such as intentional structure _comma_ semantic selectional restrictions _comma_ verb tense and aspect _comma_ modality _comma_ intonation and pitch accent are topics for further research .
2987,4,When these scores are viewed as log probabilities _comma_ taking a linear sum corresponds to making an independence assumption that is known to be at best only approximately true _comma_ and that may give rise to inaccuracies that reduce the effectiveness of the knowledge source .
2988,3,( Note that because of the random choice _comma_ there were some cases where more than one test instance came from the same numbered category . )
2989,5,The proposed modifications will again be evaluated by A _comma_ and if conflicts arise _comma_ she may propose modifications to B 's previously proposed modifications _comma_ resulting in a recursive process .
2990,1,Dialect groupings can be discovered objectively and automatically by cluster analysis of phonetic transcriptions such as those found in a linguistic atlas .
2991,3,Now _comma_ the confidence value of each attribute is equivalent to its salience within the context of the referring expression .
2992,2,We achieve a moderate but significant improvement in performance over n-gram models and the Inside-Outside algorithm in the first two domains _comma_ while in the part-of-speech domain we are outperformed by n-gram models but we vastly outperform the Inside-Outside algorithm .
2993,3,If we consider the dynamics to be a direct representation of processing _comma_ then a dependence of linguistic data upon parsing states would only seem plausible if the parsing process corresponds _comma_ at least to some extent _comma_ with actual human language processing .
2994,3,When S  expresses a state _comma_ it is possible for the temporal relation to hold between the event described by S and the event or activity most closely preceding S _comma_ i.e. _comma_ the temporal focus of S _comma_ here referred to as TF .
2995,5,The psychological desirability of such a Full Attachment model has been argued for _comma_ especially with regard to the processing of head-final languages _comma_ where evidence has been found of pre-head structuring Inoue and Fodor 1991 _comma_ Frazier 1987 .
2996,2,In  _comma_ the second sentence is an elaboration of the first _comma_ and they therefore refer to aspects of the same event rather than to two sequential events .
2997,3,In particular _comma_ an agent may be obliged to do an action that is contrary to his goals ( for example _comma_ consider a child who has to apologize for hitting her younger brother ) .
2998,3,The implicit ordering on the times indefinitely evoked by the simple pasts in passage  results solely from understanding it as a Narration .
2999,3,Though theorem  gives an interpretation free characterisation of a satisfiable feature structure _comma_ the characterisation still seems to admit of no effective algorithm to decide if a feature structure is satisfiable .
3000,3,In the underlying knowledge sources language-specific constraints are defined .
3001,3,All three parsers have worst-case complexities that are exponential on input length .
3002,3,This occurs most frequently when common nouns are used as proper nouns ( e.g. in die gehobene Mittelklasse plaziert Renault ab 6. Mrz den Safrane ) _comma_ where one would not expect to add a tag `` proper noun '' for every noun in the lexicon .
3003,3,Let  be the reciprocal of the number of appearance of ( as its root form ) in Glossme .
3004,3,The method we propose here consists of the same three steps .
3005,4,the set of affixes and their allowed combinations _comma_ and
3006,4,These last years there has been a common agreement in the natural language processing research community on the importance of having an extensive coverage of the surface lexical semantics of the domain to work with _comma_ ( specially _comma_ typical contexts of use ) .
3007,3,I would also like to acknowledge valuable advice from Tracy Holloway King and Steven Abney _comma_ who commented on earlier versions of this paper .
3008,3,Other than the economic factor _comma_ an important advantage of combining morphological analysis and error detection / correction is the way the lexical tree associated with the analysis can be used to determine correction possibilities .
3009,3,The biggest problem is noun phrases requiring world knowledge that cannot be expressed as a dictionary default .
3010,2,First _comma_ unlike conventional word-frequency-based abstract generation systems Kuhn 1958 _comma_ the generated abstract is consistent with the original text in that the connectives between sentences in the abstract reflect their relation in the original text .
3011,3,Other factors of interest are whether the dialogues are human-to-human or human-to-computer _comma_ as well as the modality of communication _comma_ e.g. spoken or typed _comma_ since some researchers have indicated that dialogues _comma_ and particularly uses of reference within them _comma_ vary along these dimensions Cohen 1984 _comma_ Henisz Thompson 1980 _comma_ Guindon et al. 1986 _comma_ Dahlbach and Johnson 1989 _comma_ Whittaker and Stenton 1989 .
3012,3,Evaluating the default body _comma_ the system creates a V-object OBJ ' .
3013,3,This parser runs in polynomial time if implemented using Earley deduction or XOLDT resolution Warren 1992 .
3014,3,One is that it can provide some improvement to a model even in the absence of the additional ( human or computational ) resources required by a hand-coded extension .
3015,3,One default for choosing a missing case-value is specified as follows :
3016,3,Secondly _comma_ it is psycholinguistically well-founded in that the approach adopts a local activation processing model instead of relies upon symbol passing _comma_ as symbolic systems usually do .
3017,3,These include :
3018,5,This model can be implemented using Gallier 's theory of autonomous belief revision and the corresponding system Galliers 1991 .
3019,5,The usual approach here is to hypothesise all tags in the tagset for an unknown word _comma_ other than ones where all the words that may have the tag can be enumerated in advance ( closed class tags ) .
3020,5,While we do not claim that speakers really behave in such an orderly fashion _comma_ an algorithm that expects this kind of behavior is more successful than those which depend solely on recency or parallelism of grammatical function .
3021,3,for each  and each _comma_ if is defined then is defined _comma_ and _comma_ and
3022,1,We wish to find a method for identifying easily computable parameters that rapidly classify previously unseen texts in general classes and along a small set - smaller than Biber 's five - of dimensions _comma_ such that they can be explained in intuitively simple terms to the user of an information retrieval application .
3023,2,Cases where statistical techniques seem less appropriate are where plausibility is affected by local context .
3024,3,Secondly _comma_ by setting a threshold value of 1 _comma_ LHIP can be made to perform like a standardly interpreted Prolog DCG _comma_ though somewhat more efficiently due to the use of the chart .
3025,5,Dynamic grammars can be presented as rewrite grammars by using transition types instead of the more usual S or NP .
3026,4,A similar phenomenon appears to be taking place in the next set of sentences :
3027,5,Applicative Categorial Grammar is the most basic form of Categorial Grammar _comma_ with just a single combination rule corresponding to function application .
3028,3,Now for some examples .
3029,3,This means that _comma_ assuming we decide initially to attach low _comma_ but number agreement on was subsequently forces high attachment _comma_ as in  _comma_ then a conscious garden path effect will be predicted _comma_ as lowering cannot derive the reanalysis .
3030,4,and so can each of the middle substrings e.g .
3031,3,enforce a linearization on subproofs to be presented _comma_ or
3032,5,redistributing among the unseen events the probability mass freed by discounting .
3033,3,We end by recommending that an underspecified representation of the structure using these techniques be used to avoid generating the temporal / rhetorical structure until higher-level information can be used to disambiguate .
3034,4,In this example _comma_ interpretation must not only be before the end of the sentence _comma_ but before a constituent boundary ( the verb phrase in the user 's command has not yet been completed ) .
3035,3,Note that  _comma_ and that if c = s the rule has completely covered the span _comma_ consuming all terminals .
3036,7,This paper is organized as follows : We first review a general algorithm for least-errors recognition .
3037,3,for each i < n _comma_ [  is defined _comma_ and _comma_ and
3038,3,Paradigme provides the former dimension -- an associative system of words -- as a screen onto which the meaning of a word is projected like a still picture .
3039,3,Finally _comma_ the similarity-based model may be applied to configurations other than bigrams .
3040,3,is a set _comma_
3041,7,After identifying the conditions under which defaults are triggered ( section  ) _comma_ the application of a default ( section ) and the definition of its description ( section ) is outlined .
3042,3,The minimal purpose of any dialogue is that an utterance be understood _comma_ and this goal is a prerequisite to achieving other goals in dialogue _comma_ such as commitment to future action .
3043,3,As explained in Introduction _comma_ the problem of learning case frame patterns can be viewed as that of estimating the underlying multi-dimensional joint distribution which gives rise to such data .
3044,3,For instance _comma_ Cat could be  _comma_ Atom might be and Feat might be .
3045,3,Using a thesaurus constructed by our method can improve pp-attachment disambiguation results .
3046,2,The main difference between our approach and that of Milward 1992 _comma_ Milward 1994a is that it is based on a more expressive grammar formalism _comma_ Applicative Categorial Grammar _comma_ as opposed to Lexicalised Dependency Grammar .
3047,3,We show that in modeling social interaction _comma_ particularly dialogue _comma_ the attitude of obligation can be a useful adjunct to the popularly considered attitudes of belief _comma_ goal _comma_ and intention and their mutual and shared counterparts .
3048,6,I discuss two possible filter optimizations based on a program transformation technique called unfolding Tamaki and Sato 1984 also referred to as partial execution Pereira and Shieber 1987 .
3049,3,Exhaustive search for the global optimum is not an option when the search space is prohibitively large .
3050,1,PROVERB main feature is that it combines global hierarchical planning and unplanned organization of text with respect to local derivation relations in a complementary way .
3051,3,It is possible that more complicated probabilistic dependency graphs like Bayesian networks would be more appropriate for representing case frame patterns .
3052,3,While the system uses the rhetorical relations of the first sentence of each paragraph for this analysis _comma_ it executes the same steps as it does for the intra-paragraph analysis .
3053,5,In the case of grammatical language modeling _comma_ this corresponds to taking
3054,3,the far away outside .
3055,5,Mutual beliefs can be inferred based on some evidence _comma_ but these beliefs may depend on underlying assumptions that are easily defeasible .
3056,3,In addition _comma_ any next utterance by the addressee can upgrade the strength of the underlying assumptions to default ( See Figure  ) .
3057,5,`` ... should not only contain information on the structural possibilities of the general language system _comma_ but also on details of actual language use in a language community . ''
3058,3,Rather than giving such prominence to the root feature structure _comma_ we suggest that the entire derivation tree should be seen as the object that is derived from the input _comma_ i.e. _comma_ this is what the parser returns .
3059,3,However _comma_ once the preposition with has been attached _comma_ the required N ' node will no longer be accessible _comma_ and a conscious garden path effect will be predicted _comma_ which _comma_ intuitively _comma_ does not occur .
3060,3,There are interactions of scope between definite NPs and other types of expression : in Each man kills the thing he loves _comma_ the presuppositional construct the thing he loves requires the existence of a single target of affection per man .
3061,3,In an envisioned application _comma_ a user will employ a cascade of filters starting with filtering by topic _comma_ and continuing with filters by genre or text type _comma_ and ending by filters for text quality _comma_ or other tentative finer-grained qualifications .
3062,3,It is fairly good for prepositions _comma_ determiners _comma_ pronouns _comma_ conjunctions _comma_ the infinitive marker _comma_ modals _comma_ and the possessive marker .
3063,3,Each resolved feature structure is a well-typed Carpenter 1992 feature structure with output alphabet .
3064,3,Tone and F  in Bamileke Dschang
3065,1,This paper compares a qualitative reasoning model of translation with a quantitative statistical model .
3066,3,Like gapping _comma_ VP-ellipsis results in an empty constituent in the syntax _comma_ in this case _comma_ a verb phrase .
3067,3,replace each noun in the collocations with thesaurus categories _comma_ to obtain the collocations of thesaurus categories .
3068,7,Section  discusses assumption ; section shows how assumption can be dropped ; section discusses ; section shows that some IRU 's facilitate the inference of relations between adjacent propositions .
3069,3,We show how a deduction can be performed to derive a meaning for example  using the meaning constructors in _comma_ R-relations and _comma_ and Axiom I.
3070,5,For example _comma_ word sense ambiguities in input data can be treated in a unified manner .
3071,5,A crucial assumption of Clark and Wilkes-Gibbs 's work -- and of Heeman and Hirst 's model -- is that the recipient of the initial referring expression already has some knowledge of the referent in question .
3072,5,The resulting specialized grammar was compiled into LR parsing tables _comma_ and a special LR parser exploited their special properties Samuelsson 1994b .
3073,1,This paper presents a text planner for the verbalization of natural deduction ( ND ) style proofs Gentzen 1935 .
3074,3,In the first experiment _comma_ sentence hypotheses were evaluated on the N-grams of words and word classes they contained .
3075,7,This concludes the discussion of the F  prediction function .
3076,3,adjective vs. verb ( appliqu _comma_ devenu _comma_ fabriqu ) _comma_
3077,5,In these theories _comma_ the speaker has the intention that the hearer either know the referent or identify it immediately .
3078,2,In addition our methodology is different from other studies because we have attempted to provide an explanation for whole dialogues rather than fragments of dialogues _comma_ and used explicit criteria in a bottom-up manner to identify discourse structures .
3079,3,An example ( due to Mark Steedman ) _comma_ which may be such a case _comma_ is the following _comma_
3080,3,Instruments have been developed and tested for controlling the coverage and for avoiding a large number of short reductions _comma_ which is argued to be the main source to poor parser performance .
3081,5,This problem is analyzed in de Swart 1991 as an instance of the proportion problem and given a solution from a Generalized Quantifier approach .
3082,3,One where a bike is stolen by someone ( or rather _comma_ where a singleton set of bikes is stolen ) .
3083,3,While this rule will adequately analyse simple NPs such as your map _comma_ or a missionary camp _comma_ on a NP such as the bottom right-hand corner it will give analyses for the bottom _comma_ the right-hand and the corner .
3084,5,This node expansion corresponds to an application of the ( predict ) - rule in the following abstract specification of a top-down generator .
3085,3,all items in Cat and Atom
3086,3,In tree structure terms we have :
3087,5,indicates to everyone in P that .
3088,3,The constraints in main clause are stated as identity relations between motivated which comes from subordinate clause _comma_ and other semantic roles appearing in main clause .
3089,3,Definition 19 .
3090,3,My claim is that informationally redundant utterances ( IRU 's ) have two main discourse functions :
3091,3,My research suggests that this may be done by using string distances computed directly on phonetic transcriptions _comma_ and that this is better than restricting the study to lexical comparisons .
3092,3,Usually this feature-clash situation creates the problem of which constituent to give preference to Langer 1990 .
3093,3,When we find a superior grammar _comma_ we make this the new hypothesis grammar .
3094,3,When another agent requests that some action be performed _comma_ the request itself brings an obligation to address the request : that is _comma_ either to accept it or to reject it ( and make the decision known to the requester ) - the requestee is not permitted to ignore the request .
3095,3,The set of default preconditions expresses possible reasons for dead-end situations .
3096,5,It is known that as a strategy of estimation _comma_ MDL is guaranteed to be near optimal .
3097,3,This is conventionally a `` single layer '' net _comma_ since there is one layer of processing nodes .
3098,4,The hearer needs to be confident that the description will be adequate as a means of identifying the referent _comma_ but because of the inevitable differences in beliefs about the world _comma_ he might not be .
3099,3,Let us call these nodes `` cutnodes '' .
3100,3,But in contrast to most unsupervised learning settings _comma_ the objects involved have no internal structure or attributes allowing them to be compared with each other .
3101,4,Part-of-speech tagging is the process of assigning grammatical categories to individual words in a corpus .
3102,3,When the test corpus is very similar to the model _comma_ then the pattern is initial maximum .
3103,3,This approach can be extended by taking adjacent words which act jointly as single lexical items as a unit .
3104,3,Note that the combination for such items does not behave the same in English _comma_ where the final information is explicitly brought by the preposition into _comma_ which is a directional preposition _comma_ and where this particular combination does not create new information .
3105,3,Note that this observation holds for the model in general _comma_ not just for the specialised version of the model as applied to Bamileke Dschang .
3106,4,The quality of the perfect and imperfect vowels of the basic forms of the Semitic verbs are idiosyncratic .
3107,3,A record is kept of their original ordering _comma_ and this record allows each clause to be constrained with respect to the clause that precedes it _comma_ as well as with respect to the next head clause which follows it .
3108,7,Next we show how they have been imported into the HPSG framework .
3109,3,A final transformation consists in associating a given surface form with its ambiguity class _comma_ i.e. with the alphabetically ordered sequence of all its possible tags .
3110,4,For instance _comma_ in rule  the NP schema indicates that the f-structure associated with the NP node is the value of the subj feature in the f-structure associated with the mother node .
3111,3,The coordination rule becomes :
3112,3,A possible improvement to the guesser would be to incorporate frequent spelling errors for words that are not otherwise recognised .
3113,3,Some of the SRs could be best gathered in a unique class .
3114,5,With each utterance  is associated a list of forward-looking centers _comma_ _comma_ consisting of those discourse entities that are directly realized or realized by linguistic expressions in the utterance .
3115,3,Under examination will be the number of errors missed / caught and wrongly / rightly corrected .
3116,3,Despite little apparent theoretical difference between the CLE and ANLT grammar formalisms _comma_ and the fact that no explicit or formal process of ` tuning ' parsers and grammars to perform well with each other has been carried out in either of the ANLT or CLARE systems _comma_ the results of the experiment comparing the performance of the respective parsers using the ANLT grammar suggests that the parallel development of the software and grammars that has occurred nevertheless appears to have caused this to happen automatically .
3117,5,This excerpt from Clark and Wilkes-Gibbs 's data illustrates rejection ( line 2 ) _comma_ replacement ( line 2 ) _comma_ and acceptance ( lines 3 and 4 ) :
3118,2,Further examples which are problematic for Sag et al. are given by Jorgensen and Abeille 1992 .
3119,3,A case in point is `` a '' vs. `` an '' .
3120,2,However _comma_ there are cases in which this can only be done by obscuring the underlying linguistic theory with the `` tricks '' needed for implementation .
3121,3,The wffs of are defined as follows :
3122,4,Kitano 1990 gives an example for defaults in the context of simultaneous interpretation : In Japanese _comma_ negation is specified at the end of the sentence while in English _comma_ it has to be specified in front of the finite verb .
3123,3,One case where the dynamic grammars correctly violate the substring hypothesis is when a string already involves a coordination .
3124,3,We aim to develop an efficient storing mechanism using a hierarchy of locally intersecting core descriptions .
3125,1,We have developed and implemented a method for automatically extracting class-based SRs from on-line corpora .
3126,3,Support for bidirectional parsing Satta and Stock to appear is another candidate for inclusion in a later version .
3127,5,Traverse all branches below node X to the left of path p in a left-to-right _comma_ breadth-first manner _comma_ but do not go below any NP or S node encountered .
3128,3,This is especially the case with the `` ing '' words which _comma_ in general _comma_ can act as nouns _comma_ adjectives and gerunds and only direct lexicalization can restrict the search space _comma_ as in the case with the word `` going '' which cannot be an adjective but only a noun and a gerund .
3129,3,We focus on the linguistic basis of these approaches _comma_ using only selectional restrictions _comma_ so that our analysis is independent of the vagaries of a particular knowledge representation .
3130,1,The possible use of probabilistic information in principle-based grammars and parsers is considered _comma_ including discussion on some theoretical and computational problems that arise .
3131,4,Thus A girl walks is accepted by this grammar .
3132,3,The adaptation of our general discussion of default handling to the system VM-GEN not only provides concrete examples for the reader but also shows that a homogeneous combination of default handling _comma_ regular processing _comma_ and utterance repair is possible .
3133,1,This paper presents a grammar formalism designed for use in data-oriented approaches to language processing .
3134,5,In this model _comma_ mutual beliefs depend on evidence _comma_ openly available to the conversants _comma_ plus a number of underlying assumptions .
3135,3,Using the semantic patterns we know that key and keyring are semantically close _comma_ and through that semantic link between the second and third sentences we prefer to connect the third sentence to the thread begun by the second .
3136,2,This work thus goes beyond that of Iyer et al. by focusing on the methodological importance of corpus clustering _comma_ rather than just its usefulness in improving overall system performance _comma_ and by exploring in detail the way its effectiveness varies along the dimensions of language model type _comma_ language model complexity _comma_ and number of clusters used .
3137,2,Our experimental results show that it is better to employ MDL than MLE as estimation criterion in word clustering .
3138,3,Consider the French sentence :
3139,1,Secondly _comma_ its aim is not to tackle data sparseness by grouping a large number of objects into a smaller number of classes _comma_ but to increase the precision of the model by dividing a single object ( the training corpus ) into some larger number of sub-objects ( the clusters of sentences ) .
3140,3,Function composition is similar .
3141,5,It is therefore worth giving some brief indications of how it fits in with these developments .
3142,5,Kaplan and Bresnan explain the difference as follows .
3143,3,In a sentence _comma_ if a subjective adjective is used without being followed by a verbal suffix garu _comma_ the experiencer of the subjective adjective should be the speaker of the sentence .
3144,3,The initial lexicon contains all the inflectional information .
3145,3,We turn to the completeness principle .
3146,3,The presence of a tuple in the compatibility array ( the indices of which encode which input substrings are spanned ) indicates the existence of derivations of compatible feature structures .
3147,3,This says that if we are at a c-struct node which has at least one daughter ( that is _comma_ a non-terminal node ) then one of the subtree licensing disjuncts ( or ` rules ' ) must be satisfied there .
3148,7,I begin by describing decision-tree modeling _comma_ showing that decision-tree models are equivalent to interpolated n-gram models .
3149,1,In this paper we provide a probabilistic interpretation for typed feature structures very similar to those used by Pollard and Sag .
3150,5,Shieber et al. 1990 proposed to define the ` head ' constituent h of phrase with category x on semantic grounds : the semantic representations of h and x are identical .
3151,3,What criteria _comma_ then _comma_ does he base his understanding on ?
3152,2,It is questionable whether this method can be extended to handle cases that include more than two character words without lowering accuracy .
3153,3,If you construct interpretations by paraphrasing NL sentences into a formal language which extends predicate calculus _comma_ you have to realise that the scope of quantifiers in your paraphrases may not be determined by simple structural properties of the source text .
3154,3,The use of the chart to store known results and failures allows the user to develop hybrid parsing techniques _comma_ rather than relying on the default depth-first top-down strategy given by analysing with respect to the top-most category .
3155,2,As it stands _comma_ the account does not deal with examples such as the following _comma_
3156,2,The use we make of lexical functions as interlingual representations _comma_ does not respect their original Mel'cuk -ian interpretation .
3157,3,State-Application and State-Prediction together provide the basis of a sound and complete parser .
3158,3,Suppose for simplicity that there are only 4 possible case slots corresponding respectively to the subject _comma_ direct object _comma_ ` from ' phrase _comma_ and ` to ' phrase .
3159,3,The location le jardin-the garden is the final location of the motion .
3160,6,This paper extends that work by incorporating into the modification process a strategy to determine the aspect of the proposal that the agent will address in her pursuit of conflict resolution _comma_ as well as a means of selecting appropriate evidence to justify the need for such modification .
3161,3,The algorithm should be considered as the splitting of both anaphora resolution and PP attachment procedures into several phases and not as the repetition of each procedure .
3162,3,Much the same will happen with .
3163,4,Correctly determining number is a difficult problem when translating from Japanese to English .
3164,3,T then = _comma_
3165,3,We thank Ms. Y. Yamaguchi of NIS for her programming effort .
3166,3,As we have already seen _comma_ this is done by annotating the context free rules with equations .
3167,2,Hence _comma_ our algorithm should be less prone to suboptimal local minima than the Inside-Outside algorithm .
3168,3,We have to show _comma_ when given a solution to  _comma_ how to choose a type sequence and construct an SDL proof for .
3169,5,Note that ` arg 2 ' and ` from ' should also be considered dependent via ` to ' but to a somewhat weaker degree .
3170,1,In considering ways of extending LIG _comma_ this paper has introduced the notion of partial linearity and shown how it can be manifested in the form of a constrained unification-based grammar formalism .
3171,3,If the dialogue handling capabilities of a system are relatively rigid _comma_ the system may only ask the user a small number of different questions ( modulo the filling of slots with different values ) .
3172,3,The reason why the compression rate and the key sentence coverage of the technical papers were higher than that of the editorials is considered as follows .
3173,3,As these examples illustrate _comma_ an account of question answering must go beyond recognition of speaker intentions .
3174,3,Four parameters _comma_ to be tuned experimentally _comma_ are relevant for this process : k and t _comma_ which determine the set of similar words to be considered _comma_  _comma_ which determines the relative effect of these words _comma_ and _comma_ which determines the overall importance of the similarity-based model .
3175,3,The reader can check that these conditions are met by the mapping in  and the two tables for R given above .
3176,3,induction based on word type and context _comma_ using generalized left and right context vectors .
3177,1,The computer simulations reported here are a first attempt to measure the usefulness of distributional and phonotactic information in segmenting phoneme sequences .
3178,3,In this paper _comma_ we assume that the observed data are generated by a model belonging to the class of models just described _comma_ and select a model which best explains the data .
3179,3,The knowledge of such dependencies is useful in various tasks in natural language processing _comma_ especially in analysis of sentences involving multiple prepositional phrases _comma_ such as
3180,3,The main clause triggers the introduction of an event marker e ' _comma_ and its location time marker t ' _comma_ with the DRS-condition  .
3181,2,Such cases involve reasoning with an interpretation in its immediate context _comma_ as opposed to purely judging the likelihood of a particular linguistic expression in a given application domain ( see e.g. Cooper 1993 for discussion ) .
3182,5,Consider trying to perform threading in left-to-right order during interpretation of the sentence _comma_ John left if Mary left .
3183,3,The model outlined here can be used for different types of dialogue _comma_ including dialogues in which agents are constructing mutual beliefs to support future action by them jointly or alone .
3184,3,It would be preferable to arrange matters in a more cooperative fashion so that the best ( those with the highest coverage to span ratio ) are displayed first .
3185,4,Since online text becomes available in ever increasing volumes and an ever increasing number of languages _comma_ there is a growing need for robust processing techniques that can analyze text without expensive and time-consuming adaptation to new domains and genres .
3186,3,In plan construction _comma_ the hierarchy is used for constructing initial referring expression plans _comma_ and for elaborating on inadequate plans by allowing an agent to choose the most salient properties of the referent first .
3187,4,Convergence since dealing with short entries involve discarding languages from few clues .
3188,5,These ingredient systems are obtained by varying the Lambek calculus along two dimensions : adding the permutation rule ( P ) and / or dropping the assumption that the type combinator ( which forms the sequences the systems talk about ) is associative ( N for non-associative ) .
3189,4,Consider the following example of deletion .
3190,3,Although there have been many methods of word clustering proposed to date _comma_ their objectives seem to vary .
3191,3,In this way _comma_ the syntactic position also would provide information ( statistical evidence ) for measuring the most appropriate classes .
3192,3,Typically 10 sentences take about 2 seconds _comma_ 50 sentences about 4 seconds _comma_ to process on a Sparc10 workstation .
3193,3,The following examples suggest the feature of the similarity :
3194,4,Using a declarative formalism helps ease the task of developing and maintaining the grammar Kaplan 1987 .
3195,7,Subsection  presents the formalism used _comma_ and subsection describes the model .
3196,3,The location time is an interval _comma_ used to temporally locate eventualities _comma_ in accordance with their aspectual classification .
3197,3,Will shallow processing miss too many of the errors cooperative error processing is aimed at ?
3198,4,Word groupings useful for language processing tasks are increasingly available _comma_ as thesauri appear on-line _comma_ and as distributional techniques become increasingly widespread Bensch and Savitch 1992 _comma_ Brill 1991 _comma_ Brown et al. 1992 _comma_ Grefenstette 1994 _comma_ McKeown and Hatzivassiloglou 1993 _comma_ Pereira et al. 1993 _comma_ Schuetze 1993 .
3199,5,In an incremental semantics _comma_ we would expect the information state of an interpreter to be updated word by word .
3200,3,performance on the task of deciding which of two verbs is more likely to take a given noun as direct object when the data relating one of the verbs to the noun has been witheld from the training data .
3201,3,rules are applied cascadingly using the most accurate rules first .
3202,3,Figure  defines a valuation relation for the QLF fragment used above _comma_ derived from Alshawi and Crouch 1992 _comma_ Cooper et al. 1994a .
3203,3,For reasons of space it is difficult to give examples of the sign-based output of the grammar _comma_ or of the ALE rules _comma_ so we will restrict ourselves here to a summary of the algorithm and to a very limited rendition of the system output .
3204,3,Second _comma_ we wished to test the effectiveness of our evaluation heuristics in selecting the best parse .
3205,3,The same is true for large-coverage rule-based grammars which lead to the creation of very many predictions .
3206,2,Third _comma_ there is no longer a dichotomy with respect to the level of representation from which VP-ellipsis locates and copies antecedents .
3207,2,If we want to construct a general theory of discourse than we want to know about the whole range of cues serving this function .
3208,5,In the system described in Dalrymple et al. 1993b _comma_ the relation associates expressions in the meaning language with f-structures .
3209,7,We contrast the account with relevant past work in Section  _comma_ and conclude in Section .
3210,3,It also predicts the desired reading for sentence  _comma_ since that reading requires two quantifiers .
3211,3,Some experimental results about the performance of the method are provided .
3212,1,This paper presents PROVERB a text planner for argumentative texts .
3213,3,This is indeed the approach we take in this paper .
3214,3,The question of appropriate network architecture is examined in Pao 1989 _comma_ Widrow and Lehr 1992 and Lyon 1994 .
3215,3,Second _comma_ control was exchanged when the execution of the task started to go awry .
3216,3,For the word-based or class-based models _comma_ case slots are judged independent _comma_ with the data size currently available in the Penn Tree Bank .
3217,1,In this paper _comma_ we propose a method to analyze structures of Japanese compound nouns by using both word collocations statistics and a thesaurus .
3218,5,For example _comma_ CLAWS Garside et al. 1987 normalises the lexical probabilities by the total frequency of the word rather than of the tag .
3219,5,Depending on how the referring plan constrains the choice of referent _comma_ she constructs an instance of either reject-plan or postpone-plan _comma_ whose resulting surface speech actions are s-reject and s-postpone respectively .
3220,3,A is a total function from  to the set of partial functions from U to U _comma_
3221,2,A problem not fully explored yet is how to arrive at an optimal choice of tree-cutting criteria .
3222,3,The syntactic VP could be copied down with its corresponding semantics _comma_ from which the semantics for the complete sentence can be derived .
3223,2,Furthermore _comma_ since nonterminal symbols of CFG are derived from a statistical analysis of word collocations _comma_ their number tends to be large and so the number of CFG rules are also large .
3224,3,It is also possible to view the spelling patterns and production rule tree used to produce a form ; for chre _comma_ the trace ( slightly simplified here ) is as in figure  .
3225,5,The initial model set up so that some transitions and some tags in the lexicon are favoured _comma_ and hence having a higher initial probability .
3226,3,The two main points that might require some defence are the analysis of aspect in terms of a relationship between temporal objects and event types _comma_ which is discussed in Ramsay 1993 _comma_ and the treatment of definite reference in terms of constraints on meaningfulness .
3227,3,We thank Slava Katz for discussions on the topic of this paper _comma_ Doug McIlroy for detailed comments _comma_ Doug Paul for help with his baseline back-off model _comma_ and Andre Ljolje and Michael Riley for providing the word lattices for our experiments .
3228,5,The analysis appears in  .
3229,3,Average case complexity is dependent on the quality of the first guess _comma_ how rapidly the TNCB structure is actually improved _comma_ and to what extent the TNCB must be re-evaluated after rewriting .
3230,3,The resulting model more readily accounts for discourse behavior in adversarial situations and other situations where it is implausible that the agents adopt each others goals .
3231,3,Move all such u 's ( in parallel ) between clusters .
3232,3,These are problems with :
3233,4,One contrast often taken for granted is the identification of a ` statistical-symbolic ' distinction in language processing as an instance of the empirical vs. rational debate .
3234,3,Definition 2 .
3235,3,Furthermore _comma_ the context here consists of a discussion of two tax years 1981 and 1982 .
3236,3,As a result _comma_ zero anaphora resolution of complex sentence is not only to be done syntactically _comma_ but also to be done pragmatically and / or semantically .
3237,3,Given that collocations may translate as non-collocations _comma_ we also have to provide a way to represent these expressions using lexical functions .
3238,3,This problem setting is based on the intuitive assumption that similar words occur in the same context with roughly equal likelihood _comma_ as is made explicit in equation  .
3239,3,Similarly _comma_ all noun phrases might be treated as mappings from an X / np to an X .
3240,5,Instead _comma_ they make a detour via the LFG construction algorithm _comma_ which explains how equational constraints linking subtrees and feature structures are to be resolved .
3241,3,Note that there is a trade-off between recall and accuracy -- if all possible segmentation points were added _comma_ recall would be 100 % but accuracy would be low ; likewise _comma_ if only one segmentation point was added between two words _comma_ accuracy would be 100 % but recall would be low .
3242,5,Krifka 1993 argues that in - and - _comma_ and in a number of other situations as well _comma_ the focus marker is used to extract part of the interpretation .
3243,3,Here we have separated the issue of arriving at the appropriate f-structure in the syntax from the issue of deriving the correct semantics from the f-structure .
3244,2,However _comma_ for many tasks _comma_ one is interested in relationships among word senses _comma_ not words .
3245,3,Categorization sentences with linguistic properties shows that difficult problems have sometimes simple solutions .
3246,3,A common mistake is to choose the wrong pattern .
3247,4,Each of these says that I didn't steal your car _comma_ but again they each carry some extra message .
3248,3,This contrasts with simple negation _comma_ with no focussed item _comma_ as in :
3249,3,The underlying principle employed at each step is to take a sentence _comma_ or part of a sentence _comma_ and generate strings with the boundary markers of the syntactic constituent in question placed in all possible positions .
3250,3,Future work is planned to extend this very limited partial parser _comma_ and decompose sentences further into their hierarchical constituent parts .
3251,6,Hypothetical reasoning by keeping track of dependencies between items
3252,3,These properties motivated our choice of relative entropy for similarity measure _comma_ because of the intuition that words with sharper distributions are more informative about other words than words with flat distributions .
3253,3,But semantic interpretation _comma_ viewed as building a description of the intended composition _comma_ is a better prospect .
3254,3,In other two-person dialogues _comma_ both parties may contribute discourse entities to the conversation on a more equal basis .
3255,3,The decomposition of the problem can be investigated further : for instance _comma_ should the tag disambiguation task precede the placement of the subject boundary markers in a separate step ?
3256,3,This small lexicon contained only 5_comma_456 entries out of 53_comma_015 entries of the original Brown Corpus lexicon .
3257,1,An experiment designed to explore the relationship between tagging accuracy and the nature of the tagset is described _comma_ using corpora in English _comma_ French and Swedish .
3258,5,Some researchers _comma_ e.g. _comma_ Mann 1988 _comma_ Kowtko et al. 1991 _comma_ assume a library of discourse level actions _comma_ sometimes called dialogue games _comma_ which encode common communicative interactions .
3259,1,We now give a similarity-based method for estimating the probabilities of cooccurrences unseen in training .
3260,3,Note that when we do not have enough data ( i.e. for small N ) _comma_ the thresholds will be large and few nodes tend to be linked _comma_ resulting in a simple model in which most of the case slots are judged independent .
3261,3,We didn't find any such case .
3262,3,Final ( like to )
3263,4,Drawing appropriate defeasible inferences has been proven to be one of the most pervasive puzzles of natural language processing and a recurrent problem in pragmatics .
3264,7,Finally _comma_ I give some examples of multiple _comma_ automatically-generated transcriptions of the same F  data .
3265,5,Accordingly _comma_ it casts its linguistic analyses in terms of a composite ontology : two independent domains -- a domain of constituency information ( c-structure ) _comma_ and a domain of grammatical function information ( f-structure ) -- linked together in a mutually constraining manner .
3266,3,In the final section we have seen that the combination of informational monotonicity with the assumption of strict incrementality results in a system which is too constrained to capture all the processing data .
3267,4,Zero subject of - te phrase is [+anaphoric_comma_+pronominal ] or PRO in GB term Sells 1985 .
3268,3,The introduction of the proposed method improved the percentage of correct sentences from 5 % to 12 .
3269,3,There is a wealth of formul to compute readability .
3270,3,M is a morph iff [ M is a semi-morph  _comma_ and
3271,3,is prohibited _comma_ along with the other extractions that do not remove c from the body of the abstraction .
3272,1,The primary contribution of research reported in this paper is that we have proposed a method of learning dependencies between case frame slots _comma_ which is theoretically sound and efficient _comma_ thus providing an effective tool for acquiring case dependency information .
3273,3,Suppose that the abstract is longer than the expected length .
3274,3,It provides a learnable lexical selection sub-system for a connectionist transfer project in machine translation .
3275,7,Section  discusses the theoretical aspects of the similarity .
3276,3,induction based on word type and context
3277,3,So _comma_ if  is defined then the denotation of attribute acts upon each object in the denotation of type to yield an object in the denotation of type .
3278,3,Furthermore _comma_ the grammar is required to obey what I refer to as the dependency constraint :
3279,5,To a large extent _comma_ dialectologists have found these questions difficult to answer because they accepted Paris 's conundrum .
3280,3,As mentioned in section  _comma_ there are cases where this process stops ( caused by underspecification of the input ) before finishing its output .
3281,5,For the purposes of this implementation _comma_ I have interpreted this to mean that each word must be attached into a fully-connected phrase marker as it is found in the input .
3282,3,If some anaphora are left unresolved _comma_ apply the anaphora module again .
3283,5,The original rules of the program are extended such that these bindings can be made effective .
3284,3,As long as distinct uses of the same verb can have different SRs _comma_ we permit to extract more than one class for the same syntactic position .
3285,4,As generating articles and number is only important when the rest of the sentence has been correctly generated _comma_ there has not been a lot of research devoted to it .
3286,2,However _comma_ the performance of the resulting HMM is very poor if no initial biases are used to help the training process find suitable parameters .
3287,3,For example _comma_ deciding ` littlekitty ' is a word is less disastrous than deciding ` li ' _comma_ ` tle ' _comma_ ` ki ' and ` ty ' are all words _comma_ because assigning meaning to ` littlekitty ' is a reasonable first try at learning word-meaning pairs _comma_ whereas trying to assign separate meanings to ` li ' and ` tle ' is problematic .
3288,3,So _comma_ if  then the denotation of type contains the denotation of type .
3289,3,if n > 0 _comma_ and  are wffs _comma_ then so is .
3290,3,By induction on the length of  .
3291,1,This paper presents a computational strategy for detecting conflicts regarding proposed beliefs and for engaging in collaborative negotiation to resolve the conflicts that warrant resolution .
3292,3,Next _comma_ I observe that transcribing a sequence X of pitch ( i.e. F  ) values amounts to finding a tone sequence T such that .
3293,7,This section discusses the results of comparing the Explicit-Warrant discourse strategy with the All-Implicit discourse strategy to determine when each strategy is BENEFICIAL .
3294,2,However _comma_ in many cases there are several distinct maximal parses _comma_ each consisting of a different subset of words of the original sentence .
3295,3,Taking the various components in turn _comma_ we make a note of undesirable properties that might be improved by quantitative modeling .
3296,4,Recent years have seen a resurgence of interest in probabilistic techniques for automatic language analysis .
3297,5,CCG is one of several theories in which  gets derived by raising John to be the LF _comma_ where P is a predicate that takes a NP as an argument to return a sentence .
3298,5,We could smooth the estimated probabilities using an existing smoothing technique Dagan et al. 1992 _comma_ Gale and Church 1990 _comma_ then calculate some similarity measure using the smoothed probabilities _comma_ and then cluster words according to it .
3299,5,A statistical-based suffix learner is presented in Schmid 1994 .
3300,3,For each node  _comma_ compute thickness of each subrfrant in the following way :
3301,3,The values of the accuracies and the test conditions are unimportant here ; all we want to show is the general patterns .
3302,3,It is based on the general assumption that neologisms and uncommon words tend to follow regular inflectional patterns .
3303,4,This is mainly due to the clear theoretical and practical advantages of bidirectional grammar use Appelt 1987 .
3304,3,When the co-occurrence likelihood can not be measured _comma_ the value  was set to 0 .
3305,5,Gorrell employs the D-theoretic device of building up a set of dominance and precedence relations between nodes _comma_ where the set is intended to be constrained by informational monotonicity _comma_ in that once asserted to the set _comma_ no relation may be deleted or overridden .
3306,3,The theoretical complexity of the generator is  _comma_ where n is the size of the input .
3307,1,This paper discusses the lexicographical concept of lexical functions Mel'cuk and Zolkovsky 1984 and their potential exploitation in the development of a machine translation lexicon designed to handle collocations .
3308,3,Add links  to _comma_ where is a link to the node with thickness .
3309,3,There may be an argument for similarly blocking coordination in cases which would involve the breaking apart of idioms or other structures which are not standard cases of lexical subcategorisation .
3310,3,The former comparison shows that the sources combined are more useful than phonotactic information alone .
3311,3,The syntactic structure underspecifies the intended composition _comma_ so that the meanings of some constituents ( e.g. pronouns ) and the mode of combination of other ( e.g. quantifiers ) are not fully specified .
3312,3,We thank Mr. K. Nakamura _comma_ Mr. T. Fujita _comma_ and Dr. K. Kobayashi of NEC C & C Res. Labs. for their constant encouragement .
3313,3,But even with high-frequency words _comma_ the simple vector model can yield misleading similarity measurements .
3314,3,This avoids the double counting which was a problem earlier .
3315,3,We retained some of the basic assumptions about the structure of language when moving to the quantitative model .
3316,3,More interesting are the clauses for the modalities .
3317,3,Preliminary results from experiments conducted on parsing speech recognized spontaneous speech are also reported .
3318,3,However _comma_ further research is needed to determine how realistic these estimates turn out to be .
3319,3,The interpretation of an utterance will often be clear even without coherence with prior expectations .
3320,3,Then _comma_ divide  into in proportion to their frequency .
3321,3,Hand-coded tree-cutting criteria .
3322,3,This research was supported in part by a grant from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada .
3323,3,Our small study confirms the basic findings of the early readability studies : the most important factors of the ones we tested are word length _comma_ sentence length _comma_ and different derivatives of these two parameters .
3324,3,One improvement would be to determine possible linking of ` root-to-head ' sequences of rules _comma_ and index these to terminal items for use as an oracle during analysis .
3325,3,By setting the threshold to 1 _comma_ only those partial analyses that have no unaccounted for terminals within their spans can succeed .
3326,3,However this observer is not obligatory .
3327,3,It is also clear that relatively few of these random variables ( case slots ) are actually dependent on each other with any significance .
3328,2,How can a categorization be considered meaningful if the infinitive marker `` to '' is not distinguished from the homophonous preposition ?
3329,5,In the cue words approach _comma_ Reichman 1985 has claimed that phrases like `` because '' _comma_ `` so '' _comma_ and `` but '' offer explicit information to listeners about how the speaker 's current contribution to the discourse relates to what has gone previously .
3330,3,The listener must believe that the action proposed by the speaker is a part of an adequate plan to achieve the mutual goal and the action must also be comprehensible to the listener .
3331,1,The quality of the English in a Japanese to English Machine Translation system can be improved by the method proposed in this paper .
3332,3,In principle _comma_ all the hyperonyms ( at all levels ) of the nouns appearing in the training set are candidates .
3333,3,What is required is a slightly more indirect approach .
3334,3,The standard recursive procedure for generating partitions of k + 1 elements is to non-deterministically add the k+1thq node to each of the equivalence classes of each of the partitions of k nodes _comma_ and also to nondeterministically consider the new node as a singleton set .
3335,2,Unfortunately _comma_ the generation algorithms described to date have been intractable .
3336,3,In contrast _comma_
3337,6,Following Gruber 1965 _comma_ Jackendoff 1976 _comma_ Boons 1985 _comma_ we approach motion verbs in terms of some `` localist semantical '' role labels .
3338,2,The constraints proposed by Grosz et al. 1986 fail in certain examples like the following ( read with pronouns destressed ) :
3339,3,Now we can no longer safely assume that the coverage increases with decreased entropy _comma_ and we must also modify the interval-bisection scheme to handle this .
3340,1,In particular _comma_ the question of internal versus external criteria for tagset design is considered _comma_ with the general conclusion that external ( linguistic ) criteria should be followed .
3341,2,The conclusions are broadly in agreement with those of Merialdo 1994 _comma_ but give greater detail about the contributions of different parts of the model .
3342,3,The reduction above proves NP-hardness of the parsing problem .
3343,7,Although incorporating unification increases their complexity to exponential on grammar size and input length ( section  ) _comma_ this appears to have little impact on practical performance ( section ) .
3344,3,We evaluated our method by comparing its perplexity and effect on speech-recognition accuracy with the baseline bigram back-off model developed by MIT Lincoln Laboratories for the Wall Street Journal ( WSJ ) text and dictation corpora provided by ARPA 's HLT program Paul 1991 .
3345,3,The first method uses a genetic algorithm while the second method uses simulated annealing .
3346,3,As final step we have
3347,3,While this technique helps to confine word senses for English and French _comma_ it is of little help for word sense disambiguation in German .
3348,2,Third _comma_ the Lascarides and Asher account does not explain why the past perfect cannot stand alone nor discourses generally be opened with it ; consider stating sentence in isolation :
3349,3,To summarize _comma_ we construct a similarity-based model for  and then interpolate it with .
3350,6,Following Liberman et al. _comma_ voice pitch was varied by getting the informant to speak at different volumes and by adjusting the recording level appropriately .
3351,3,It is the pronoun in event referential forms that is anaphoric ; the fact that the pronouns refer to events results from the type constraints imposed by the main verb do .
3352,3,Simple techniques to decide the best sense c given the target noun n using estimates of the n-grams :  _comma_ _comma_ and _comma_ obtained from supervised and un-supervised corpora .
3353,3,In short a subjective predicate describes the experiencer 's inner state which can exclusively be known by the experiencer him / herself .
3354,4,Following the work of _comma_ for example _comma_ Marslen-Wilson 1973 _comma_ Just and Carpenter 1980 and Altmann and Steedman 1988 _comma_ it has become widely accepted that semantic interpretation in human sentence processing can occur before sentence boundaries and even before clausal boundaries .
3355,3,That is _comma_ while BW will converge on an optimum _comma_ the notion of optimality is with respect to the HMM rather than to the linguistic judgements about correct tagging .
3356,3,The Explicit-Warrant strategy is based on simple relationships between different facts which we would expect to occur in any domain _comma_ i.e. the fact that some belief can be used as a WARRANT for accepting a proposal should occur in almost any task .
3357,3,We next went on to examine the relationship between topic shift and the different types of cues and interruptions described earlier .
3358,3,The supporting role of the grammatic framework and the prohibition filters should not be underestimated .
3359,3,This set may consist of one ( for unambiguous words ) or more tags and is referred to as the word 's equivalence class .
3360,5,Figure  illustrates the system from the viewpoint of the dialogue manager .
3361,3,Not surprisingly _comma_ the coverage of morphological rules is much lower than that of the ending-guessing ones - for the suffix rules it is less than 40 % and for the prefix rules about 5 - 6 .
3362,2,In all experiments the dependency model provides a substantial advantage over the adjacency model _comma_ even though the latter is more prevalent in proposals within the literature .
3363,5,For instance _comma_ the recent work by Moortgat 1994 gives a systematic in-depth study of mixed Lambek systems _comma_ which integrate the systems L _comma_ NL _comma_ NLP _comma_ and LP .
3364,7,This section presents a morphographemic model which handles error detection in non-linear strings .
3365,2,Also _comma_ if at some point it was desired to determine if the semantic forms of two different sentences were the same _comma_ a predicate would be needed to compare two lambda forms for  - equivalence _comma_ which again is not a simple task .
3366,3,In essence _comma_ this principle states that in a given f-structure _comma_ a particular attribute may have at most one value .
3367,3,This condition also rules out the Turing Machine simulation .
3368,3,The verb tense determines the relation between the location time and the utterance time e.g. if the tense is simple past _comma_ the location time lies anteriorly to the utterance time .
3369,5,The speaker will form intentions based on the goals and then act on these intentions _comma_ producing utterances .
3370,3,Definition 8 .
3371,3,The subordinate clause triggers the introduction of an event marker _comma_ e _comma_ with its event time marker t .
3372,3,RHET_RELN : The relation between this DCU and a previous one .
3373,3,Two tests were conducted with each combination of the degradation and similarity _comma_ using different corpora ( from the Penn treebank ) ranging in size from approximately 50000 words to 500000 words .
3374,3,The class has cropped up because it accumulates enough evidence _comma_ provided by erroneous senses .
3375,2,The analysis of sentences such as  in de Swart 1991 _comma_ within the framework of Discourse Representation Theory ( DRT ) Kamp 1981 gives the wrong truth-conditions _comma_ when the temporal connective in the sentence is before or after .
3376,3,The past tense of the verb adds the condition  .
3377,3,At the first glance _comma_ the constraints about these relations are not local in terms of main or subordinate clauses .
3378,3,The grammar is defined in metagrammatical formalism which is compiled into a unification-based ` object grammar ' -- a syntactic variant of the Definite Clause Grammar formalism Pereira and Warren 1980 -- containing 84 features and 782 phrase structure rules .
3379,2,However _comma_ the nature of language is such that many word combinations are infrequent and do not occur in a given corpus .
3380,3,is predicted to be acceptable _comma_ as are the following _comma_
3381,2,Cohen proposed a framework for analyzing the structure of argumentative discourse Cohen 1987 _comma_ yet did not provide a concrete identification procedure for ` evidence ' relationships between sentences _comma_ where no linguistic clues indicate the relationships .
3382,5,For example _comma_ counting the characters ( excluding spaces ) in the introductory examples _comma_ we see that Hypothesis 1 uses 48 characters and Hypothesis 2 uses 75 .
3383,5,Woods and Dahl and McCord 's system are similar .
3384,3,Consequently _comma_ the better formed the initial TNCB used by the generator _comma_ the fewer the number of rewrites required to complete generation .
3385,4,In addition to syntactic processing _comma_ the systems incorporate lexical _comma_ morphological _comma_ and semantic processing _comma_ and have been applied successfully to the analysis of naturally-occurring texts Alshawi et al. 1992 _comma_ Briscoe and Carroll 1993 .
3386,3,An analysis of the divergence between our classification and the manually assigned tags revealed three main sources of errors : rare words and rare syntactic phenomena _comma_ indistinguishable distribution _comma_ and non-local dependencies .
3387,5,de Swart 1991 sees Partee 's quantification problem as a temporal manifestation of the proportion problem _comma_ which arises in cases such as Kadmon 1990 .
3388,2,This incorrectly rules out the possibility of the noun phrase referring to a rabbit which is in nothing at all .
3389,3,The mechanism for doing this involves introducing a foot feature to carry the focussed item around _comma_ and constructing appropriate abstractions by using the standard quantifier scoping mechanism which is required for other phenomena anyway .
3390,3,In the present implementation _comma_ semantic structures ( akin to logical forms ) are built word by word _comma_ and each structure is then evaluated independently using a dynamic semantics ( with threading performed according to the structure of the logical form ) .
3391,3,Because of the reordering carried out during compilation _comma_ the situation regarding left-recursion is slightly more subtle than in a conventional DCG .
3392,3,Suppose that I is an interpretation  .
3393,4,On the other hand _comma_ as Church and Hanks 1990 remark _comma_ the effort involved in analyzing and classifying all the linguistic material provided by concordances of use of a word can be extremely labor-intensive .
3394,5,The standard way to deal with the potential discrepancy between where a phrase appears and the width of its scope is by storing quantifiers on a quantifier stack until the entire sentence has been interpreted _comma_ and then using explicit information about the priority of various quantifiers to sort things out Cooper 1983 _comma_ Vestre 1991 .
3395,1,the resultant temporal relations may be further refined by constraints that coherence relations impose .
3396,3,Three things are striking about this data .
3397,3,The resulting clusters are intuitively informative _comma_ and can be used to construct class-based word coocurrence models with substantial predictive power .
3398,3,a synchronisation modality  _comma_
3399,3,The non-deterministic nature of evaluation and the role of substitutions draws us to conclude that ellipsis substitutions operate on ( descriptions of ) the semantic compositions _comma_ not the results of such compositions .
3400,3,for each  and each _comma_ [ [ if and is defined then
3401,3,An attempted solution to this problem is to impose restrictions on neighbouring cutnodes .
3402,3,Discriminant analysis makes it possible use a large number of parameters that may be specific for a certain corpus or information stream _comma_ and combine them into a small number of functions _comma_ with the parameters weighted on basis of how useful they are for discriminating text genres .
3403,3,Of particular interest is the problem of how the parser decides which relations to add to the set at each point in time _comma_ especially at disambiguating points .
3404,4,There are both theoretical and practical motivations .
3405,5,For this small example _comma_ writing such an apply predicate is not difficult .
3406,1,I argue that this problem can be addressed by clustering the sentences in a training corpus automatically into subcorpora on the criterion of entropy reduction _comma_ and calculating separate language model parameters for each cluster .
3407,7,We then show how different classes of pragmatic inferences can be captured using this formalism _comma_ and how our algorithm computes the expected results for a representative class of pragmatic inferences .
3408,1,In this paper we describe a new fully automatic technique for learning part-of-speech guessing rules .
3409,5,Vijay-Shanker and Weir 1993 showed that the behaviour of the naive algorithm can be improved upon .
3410,4,For example _comma_ the conventional interpretation of the description ` it is black ' is true of a soot particle _comma_ but false of a snowflake .
3411,3,Others denote only possible change of position ( courir-to run ) .
3412,3,The same result obtains if we abstract away from the particular implementational details of tree-lowering _comma_ and return to the abstract level at which Gorrell states his model .
3413,3,At first sight _comma_ analysing non-constituent coordination using phrasal ( i.e. constituent ) coordination seems nonsensical .
3414,3,The current version of the implementation uses a straightforward tokenizer accepting one line per token .
3415,3,This provides a state-transition or dynamic model of processing _comma_ with each state being a pair of a syntactic type and a semantic value .
3416,3,The similarity between words is computed by spreading activation on the semantic network Paradigme which is systematically constructed from a subset of the English dictionary LDOCE .
3417,5,Based on the above structural assumption _comma_ dual-coding theory proposes a parallel set of processing assumptions .
3418,4,h. YUP THAT KNOCKS HER OUT .
3419,2,The previously proposed semantic-head-driven generation methods run into problems if none of the daughter constituents in the syntacto-semantic rule schemata of a grammar fits the definition of a semantic head given in Shieber et al. 1990 .
3420,3,It therefore seems likely that grammars of the type considered in this paper ( i.e. with relatively detailed phrase structure components _comma_ but comparatively simple from a unification perspective ) _comma_ although realistic _comma_ do not bring the parsing algorithms involved anywhere near the worst-case complexity .
3421,3,Then under what circumstances is the phonetic interpretation of both sequences the same under their respective interpretation functions ?
3422,3,Thus the target joint distribution is likely to be approximable by the product of several component distributions of low order _comma_ and thus have in fact a reasonably small number of parameters .
3423,3,S / he is merely present to execute the actions indicated by the knowledgeable participant .
3424,3,I have argued that without it a broad coverage system would be impossible .
3425,3,handling cliticised forms appropriately for the tagger 's needs .
3426,3,for some  _comma_ [ _comma_
3427,3,As for lhip_ms_success _comma_ but lists only successful instances of rule N .
3428,5,The LHS of each new rule will be the LHS phrase of the original grammar rule at the root of the tree chunk and the RHS will be the RHS phrases of the rules in the leaves of the tree chunk .
3429,3,we use the results presented here for refining the notions of the Aktionsart _comma_ where the structuration of the space in 4 zones can be used to distinguish sub-classes inside the traditional well known classes of aspectual studies .
3430,6,MIS is similar to mutual infromation used by Church to calculate semantic dependencies between words Church et al. 1991 .
3431,5,In his study _comma_ he clusters features according to covariance _comma_ to find underlying dimensions Biber 1989 .
3432,5,Translating Bar-Hillel 's notation into a feature based notation similar to that in HPSG Pollard and Sag 1994 _comma_ we obtain the following category for a ditransitive verb such as put :
3433,3,An extended definition of satisfaction and a notion of `` optimism '' with respect to different interpretations yield the preferred interpretations for an utterance or sequences of utterances .
3434,4,In processing languages such as Japanese _comma_ ambiguities in segmentation should be resolved at the same time as analyzing structure .
3435,3,Firstly _comma_ four different degrees of degradation were used : no degradation at all _comma_ D2 degradation of the lexicon _comma_ T1 degradation of the transitions _comma_ and the two together .
3436,5,For example _comma_ it has been argued that the weaker notion of constituency provided by Categorial Grammars is exactly what is required to allow all conjuncts to be treated as constituents Steedman 1985 .
3437,3,As the annealing parameter increases _comma_ existing clusters become unstable and subdivide _comma_ yielding a hierarchical `` soft '' clustering of the data .
3438,3,By looking at items parsed in the first case but not in the second _comma_ one can identify features of noun phrases found in the corpus that are not covered by the current rules .
3439,3,That phonetic comparison is more precise is not particularly surprising _comma_ since etymon identity ignores a wealth of phonetic _comma_ phonological _comma_ and morphological data _comma_ whereas comparing phones has the side effect of also counting higher-level variation : if words differ in morphemes _comma_ their phonetic difference is going to be high .
3440,3,Note that the fact _comma_ that this problematic case doesn't show up in the correct analysis of normal NL sentences _comma_ doesn't mean that a parser wouldn't have to try it _comma_ unless some arbitrary bound to that number is assumed .
3441,3,We also see that l = 88 Hz and h = 96 Hz .
3442,3,With our current size corpus there is not enough data .
3443,3,Words not found in the lexicon are analysed by a separate finite-state transducer _comma_ the guesser .
3444,5,If X is not the highest S node in the sentence _comma_ continue to step  .
3445,5,The above approaches have concentrated on particular surface linguistic phenomena and then investigated what a putative cue serves to signal in a number of dialogues .
3446,7,The crucial case of removing defaults not coinciding with newly arriving input in an incremental system is discussed in section  .
3447,2,For example _comma_ dependencies between words exist at separations greater than those allowed for by trigrams ( for which long-distance N-grams Jelinek et al. 1991 are a partial remedy ) _comma_ and associating scores with parsing table states may not model all the important correlations between grammar rules .
3448,3,Given that the notion of a symbol _comma_ let alone an ` internal symbol ' _comma_ is itself a slippery one _comma_ it may be unwise to build our theories of language _comma_ or even the way we classify different theories _comma_ on this notion .
3449,3,An experiment is conducted with 160_comma_000 word collocations to analyze compound nouns of with an average length of 4.9 characters .
3450,3,In this paper _comma_ for semantics of Japanese complex sentence _comma_ we introduce new pragmatic roles called observer and motivated respectively to bridge semantic roles of subordinate and those of main clauses .
3451,1,Our problem can be seen as that of learning a joint distribution of pairs from a large sample of pairs .
3452,3,This study therefore takes a different approach .
3453,5,For example _comma_ the CLARE interface to the Autoroute PC package Lewin et al. 1993 has a fairly simple dialogue model which allows it to ask only a dozen or so different types of question of the user .
3454,4,The ability to deal with large amounts of possibly ill-formed text is one of the principal objectives of current NLP research .
3455,4,In collaborative planning activities _comma_ since the agents are autonomous and heterogeneous _comma_ it is inevitable that conflicts arise in their beliefs during the planning process .
3456,3,Evidence of acceptance may be given explicitly _comma_ but acceptance can be inferred in some dialogue situations via the operation of a simple principle of cooperative dialogue :
3457,3,So _comma_ for a referring plan to be valid _comma_ it must describe a unique object _comma_ and it must be adequate with respect to the speaker 's beliefs .
3458,5,Productions specify not only how nonterminals can be rewritten but also how their associated stacks are modified .
3459,3,Since the number of parameters in a multi-dimensional joint distribution is exponential in general _comma_ it is infeasible to accurately estimate them in practice .
3460,3,Other accounts legislate that helpful agents should adopt other 's beliefs and intentions or that acceptance depends on whether or not the agent previously believed  p Litman and Allen 1990 _comma_ Grosz and Sidner 1990 .
3461,3,Some aspects of the structure of dialogue arises from the structure of these purposes and their relation to one another .
3462,3,This solution is not prone to de Swart 1991 's criticism against the naive solution of moving the reference time to the right DRS .
3463,5,Propose as the antecedent any NP node encountered that has an NP or S node on the path from it to X .
3464,3,The intuition is that these sets denote the syntactic categories _comma_ the atomic values _comma_ and the features that the linguist has chosen for some language .
3465,5,For each  in :
3466,1,The present paper studies the computational complexity of a variant of the Lambek Calculus that lies between L and LP_comma_ the Semidirectional Lambek Calculus SDL .
3467,3,If one agent has limited working memory _comma_ then the other agent can make the dialogue go more smoothly by adopting a strategy that makes deliberative premises salient .
3468,5,If not _comma_ another permutation is tried and the process repeated .
3469,3,Hence ` co-operative ' error processing .
3470,2,But isoglosses are frustrating .
3471,3,Indeed _comma_ for the ANLT grammar _comma_ the number of states -- the term that the CE technique reduces from exponential to linear on the grammar size -- is actually smaller in the standard LALR(1) table .
3472,3,However _comma_ we also need to evaluate clustering more rigorously as a basis for models of distributional relationships .
3473,5,It depicts the verbal representations for two different languages as two separate but connected logogen systems _comma_ characterizes the translation process as the activation along the connections between the logogen systems _comma_ and attributes the acquisition of the representation to some unspecified statistical processes .
3474,5,Dagan et al. 1993 argue that reduction to a relatively small number of predetermined word classes or clusters may cause a substantial loss of information .
3475,1,In this paper _comma_ I propose a model of the role of informationally redundant utterances in providing evidence to support inferences about mutual understanding and acceptance .
3476,3,a class guesser that assigns equivalence classes to words not covered by the lexicon _comma_
3477,3,Because f and g represent path sets entering an f-structure that they label _comma_ R-relation  ) indicates that the set of paths ( which denotes the set of paths f concatenated with SUBJ ) is a subset of the set of paths denoted by g .
3478,3,This basic idea of measuring distributional similarity in terms of shared neighbors must be modified because of the sparseness of the data .
3479,3,We now consider a hypothetical speech translation system in which the language processing components follow a conventional qualitative transfer design .
3480,3,The three filters in the filtering phase may be done in parallel .
3481,3,Japanese has no equivalent to a / an and does not distinguish between countable and uncountable quantifiers such as many / much and little / few .
3482,3,We then formulate the dependencies between case slots as the probabilistic dependencies between the random variables in each of these three models .
3483,3,Figure  summarizes these hypotheses by proposing a hypothetical decision tree for an agent 's choice of whether to use the Explicit-Warrant strategy .
3484,3,If the warrant is not already salient _comma_ then B must either infer or retrieve the warrant information or obtain it from an external source in order to evaluate A 's proposal .
3485,5,Human dialogue _comma_ in particular _comma_ task oriented dialogue is characterised by a large numbers of self-repairs Levelt 1983 _comma_ Carletta et al. 1993 _comma_ such as hesitations _comma_ insertions _comma_ and replacements .
3486,3,To take into consideration the statistical significance of the alternatives involved _comma_ before doing a generalization step _comma_ climbing upwards _comma_
3487,2,In example  _comma_ for instance _comma_ NAFTA is the object of two different verbs :
3488,3,We also investigate whether control is shared equally between participants and what percentage of control shifts are represented by abdications _comma_ interrupts _comma_ and summaries for each dialogue type .
3489,3,The connectionist processors operate within a grammatic framework _comma_ and are supported by pre-processors that filter the data and reduce the problem to a computationally tractable size .
3490,3,There is only one inference rule _comma_ namely the reduction rule  .
3491,3,The approach also raises theoretical issues .
3492,4,For example _comma_ consider :
3493,3,As this is our mathematical embodiment of c-structure ( that is _comma_ a category labeled tree ) we take it to be a pair  _comma_ where T is a finite ordered tree and is a function from the set of tree nodes to Cat .
3494,1,This paper is concerned with the detection and correction of sub-sentential English text errors .
3495,4,There are also potential computational applications for incremental interpretation _comma_ including early parse filtering using statistics based on logical form plausibility _comma_ and interpretation of fragments of dialogues ( a survey is provided by Milward and Cooper 1994 _comma_ henceforth referred to as M and C ) .
3496,3,The argument of Levelt is rather simple : When one branch is chosen to be described first _comma_ the writer has to have the choice node flagged in his memory for return .
3497,1,We define a specification language  in which ( most of ) the interactions between c - and f-structure typical of LFG grammars can be stated directly .
3498,3,Trying to use the event times would give the wrong analysis .
3499,3,That split is somewhat less sharp _comma_ possibly because not enough distinguishing contexts occur in the corpus .
3500,7,This section illustrates the substitutional treatment of ellipsis through a small number of examples .
3501,3,Iterated coordination ( e.g. for examples such as Mary _comma_ Peter and Sue ) can be treated in the same way as iterated constituent coordination is treated in phrase structure grammars .
3502,4,The external criterion is that the tagset must be capable of making the linguistic ( for example _comma_ syntactic or morphological ) distinctions required in the output corpora .
3503,3,The technical papers contains so many rhetorical expressions in general as to be expository .
3504,3,Those side advantages do not however operate when the alternation ( prefix _comma_ spelling error ) applies to a frequent word that does not follow regular ending patterns .
3505,5,Second _comma_ to explain why the Explanation relation can be inferred for passage  but not for passage _comma_ Lascarides and Asher stipulate that their causal Slipping Law ( stating that spilling can cause slipping ) requires that the CCT Law be satisfied .
3506,3,In the second domain _comma_ we derived the grammar from manually parsed text .
3507,5,Also _comma_ the use of collocations in different applications has been discussed by various authors McRoy 1992 _comma_ Pustejovsky et al. 1992 _comma_ Smadja and McKeown 1990 .
3508,3,If both positive and negative data is used _comma_ counter examples will reduce the postulated grammar so that it is nearer the real grammar .
3509,3,Recall amounts to 75.7 .
3510,5,We have also used multi-layer nets on this data : they have no advantages _comma_ and perform slightly less well Lyon 1994 .
3511,3,First _comma_ the ` ignore ' facility permits different categories of unidentified input to be distinguished .
3512,3,VPs should be viewed as a way of introducing events or possibly sets of events into the discourse .
3513,3,It would be of interest to examine data from languages with relatively freer constituent order ( e.g. German ) to determine the influence of constituent order upon centering when the grammatical functions are held constant .
3514,3,selects the most effective aspect to address in its pursuit of conflict resolution when multiple conflicts exist _comma_
3515,4,The speaker made a strategic choice in  to include since she could have simply said .
3516,3,DRSs will contain temporal markers corresponding to location times and Rpts .
3517,3,Note that the three items being examined in order to characterize the transition between each pair of anchors are the Cb of  _comma_ the Cb of _comma_ and the Cp of .
3518,3,It also includes a discussion of some of the issues which arise when parsing lexicalised grammars _comma_ and the possibilities for using statistical techniques for tuning to particular languages .
3519,7,The use of probabilistic information in principle-based grammars and parsers is considered _comma_ including discussion on some theoretical and computational problems that arise .
3520,3,We have implemented the model in Prolog .
3521,3,As the result _comma_ in general we cannot derive a useful result for category  in our theory .
3522,2,However _comma_ this simple definition seems unnatural because it does not reflect word frequency .
3523,5,Instead _comma_ an approximate model is constructed by hand _comma_ which is then improved by BW re-estimation on an untagged training corpus .
3524,3,Table  shows the input / output of two copies of the system engaging in a simplified version of Example .
3525,3,There are two notions of non-coverage of the input : sanctioned and unsanctioned non-coverage .
3526,3,It concerns rather the way of managing the interaction between the two modules .
3527,2,Given that our arguments have produced a categorial grammar which looks very similar to HPSG _comma_ why not use HPSG rather than Applicative CG ?
3528,3,Then we shall write the F  value of as .
3529,3,Moreover _comma_ an island may itself contain input which is unaccounted for by the grammar .
3530,3,Note that the number of dependent branches in the tree sets of IG is not bounded by the grammar ( e.g. _comma_ they generate sets of all full binary trees ) .
3531,2,While these accounts do help explain some discourse phenomena more satisfactorily _comma_ they still require a strong degree of co-operativity to account for dialogue coherence _comma_ and do not provide easy explanations of why an agent might act in cases that do not support high-level mutual goals .
3532,2,Several methods have been proposed to deal with each phenomenon separately _comma_ however none of proposed systems has considered the way of dealing both phenomena .
3533,3,Inflection uses some syntactic properties of an element to compute its morphological form .
3534,3,Therefore _comma_ once disambiguated the verb senses it would be possible to split the set of SRs acquired .
3535,3,As a further illustration of the constraints places on shared subtrees _comma_ Figure  shows a local tree that could appear in a derivation tree .
3536,2,It also differs from Iyer et al. 's work by clustering at the utterance rather than the paragraph level _comma_ and by using a training corpus of thousands _comma_ rather than millions _comma_ of sentences ; in many speech applications _comma_ available training data is likely to be quite limited _comma_ and may not always be chunked into paragraphs .
3537,3,The test for coincidence with the input-licensed value is realized by a comparison in the objects of VM-GEN .
3538,4,Analyzing compound nouns is one of the crucial issues for natural language processing systems _comma_ in particular for those systems that aim at a wide coverage of domains .
3539,3,The core set of default descriptions for English and German _comma_ e.g. _comma_ contains the description of a reaction to a missing number value for a noun .
3540,4,Passage  is understood as a narrative _comma_ indicating that the spilling was subsequent to the slipping .
3541,4,Starting from a single class ( or each word composing its own class ) _comma_ divide ( or merge ) word classes based on the co-occurrence data using some similarity ( distance ) measure .
3542,3,This semantics _comma_ we claim _comma_ can only be recovered by copying the syntax _comma_ as gapping does not result in an independently anaphoric expression in the semantics .
3543,5,Note in particular _comma_ that _comma_ because dominance is a transitive relation _comma_ and because of the inheritance condition on trees ( a node inherits the precedence relations of its ancestors ) _comma_ the two statements dom ( VP _comma_ NP  ) and prec ( V _comma_ NP ) remain true after reanalysis .
3544,3,Thus selecting a model which best explains the given data is equivalent to finding the most appropriate classification of words based on their co-occurrence .
3545,5,It is argued that the order-independence results from viewing semantic interpretation as building a description of a semantic composition _comma_ instead of the more common view of interpretation as actually performing the composition .
3546,4,A reference of this sort is often achieved through a collaboration between the conversants .
3547,3,The denotations of the species partition U _comma_ and S assigns each object in I the unique species whose denotation contains the object : object u is in the denotation of species  iff .
3548,3,However _comma_ we haven't solved the problem completely at this point : although tense can provide a further constraint on the temporal structure of such discourses _comma_ it can also add a further ambiguity .
3549,3,A more appealing alternative is to base the tuning on statistical methods .
3550,3,By using the same notion of head both for parsing and for generation _comma_ both techniques become even closer .
3551,3,In Table  we exhibit a simple comparison between our work and related work .
3552,5,GLR* is a recently developed robust version of the Generalized LR Parser Tomita 1986 _comma_ that can parse almost any input sentence by ignoring unrecognizable parts of the sentence .
3553,5,Because the model can play the role of both the initiator and the recipient _comma_ and because it can perform both plan construction and inference _comma_ two copies of the model can converse with one another _comma_ acting alternately as speaker and hearer .
3554,3,This state holds during the present _comma_ and so its location time is n .
3555,5,See Jowsey 1990 and Moore 1989 for a thorough discussion .
3556,3,This gives us a clear account of the relationship between a large class of feature structures and their probabilities _comma_ but does not treat re-entrancy .
3557,3,Their right similarity according to the cosine measure would be zero .
3558,3,To estimate the probabilities of classes _comma_ not directly from the frequencies of their noun members _comma_ but correcting this evidence by the number of senses of those nouns _comma_ e. g .
3559,5,If word A is used in the definition of word B _comma_ these words are expected to be strongly related .
3560,3,Definition 7 .
3561,4,The main advantage of the latter is that they provide experimental evidence of words uses .
3562,3,We choose n to yield approximately equivalent performance for each algorithm .
3563,3,Also _comma_ most computation is done in advance _comma_ when the nets are trained _comma_ so the run time computational load is low .
3564,3,We need larger tagsets to capture more linguistic information _comma_ but smaller ones to constrain the computational load .
3565,5,Pronominalization in particular serves to focus attention on what is being talked about ; inappropriate use or failure to use pronouns causes communication to be less fluent .
3566,2,Furthermore _comma_ our experience has shown that in many cases _comma_ ignoring an additional one or two input words may result in a parse that is syntactically and / or semantically more coherent .
3567,3,The bottom-up Earley deduction algorithm described here has been implemented in Quintus Prolog as part of the GeLD system .
3568,3,To overcome this difficulty _comma_ we settle with approximating the target joint distribution by the product of low order component distributions _comma_ based on corpus data .
3569,3,And _comma_ of course _comma_ there is no reason why clustering should not _comma_ where it gives an advantage _comma_ also be used in conjunction with extension by hand to produce yet further improvements .
3570,3,To achieve this _comma_ we need to interpret the relative pronouns in the two relative clauses as leaving a hole in the interpretation of clause and then abstracting with respect to that hole .
3571,3,The temporal relation between these continuations and the portion of earlier text they attach to is constrained along the lines sketched before .
3572,4,Consider a stranger approaching an agent and asking _comma_ `` Do you have the time ? '' It is unlikely that there is a joint intention or shared plan _comma_ as they have never met before .
3573,5,96 % accuracy correct assignment of tags to word token _comma_ compared with a human annotator _comma_ is quoted _comma_ over a 500000 word corpus .
3574,2,In  the subcategorisation order is swapped in the two conjuncts .
3575,3,It indicates that the model is converging towards an optimum which is better than its starting point .
3576,5,The distance vector for dictionary is derived as follows :
3577,3,In terms of general results _comma_ we have identified some factors that make evaluations of this type more complicated and which might lead us to evaluate solely quantitative results with care .
3578,3,The inference choices are the main concern of the microplanner of PROVERB Huang 1994b .
3579,3,As in Partee 1984 _comma_ such sentences trigger box-splitting .
3580,3,The listener certainly must recognize this fact .
3581,5,Figure  shows the detail of this algorithm _comma_ where denotes the number of possible values assumed by _comma_ N the input data size _comma_ and denotes the logarithm to the base 2 .
3582,5,The class-based techniques gather the different nouns by means of semantic classes .
3583,3,The compilation of morphological information is motivated by the nature of the task and of the languages to be handled .
3584,4,We can obtain identical syntactic types for a friend of and the manufacturer of by subtracting the lexical types of I _comma_ saw _comma_ Mary _comma_ 's _comma_ and handbag from the sentence type S .
3585,3,It appears that the structure-sharing techniques used with LIG cannot be generalized in a straightforward way to such formalisms .
3586,3,LHIP provides a number of ways of applying a grammar to input .
3587,3,Three main cases are faced by the algorithm :
3588,3,The result is a new state expecting an argument which _comma_ given an np could give an s i.e. an np  s .
3589,5,The CKY algorithm is a bottom-up recognition algorithm for CFG .
3590,3,In the evaluation of tagging accuracy on unknown words we pay attention to two metrics .
3591,3,The three penalties are then summed _comma_ together with the converted statistical score of the parse .
3592,3,Referential noun phrases are ones that refer to some specific referent ; for example ` Two dogs chase a cat ' .
3593,3,Clustering can be useful even when there is no reason to believe the training corpus naturally divides into any particular number of clusters on any extrinsic grounds .
3594,3,Corresponding to the partial linearity of PLIG _comma_ we permit subtrees that are not shared with the mother to be shared amongst the daughters .
3595,5,Previous work by Manny Rayner and the author Samuelsson and Rayner 1991 attempts to tailor an existing natural-language system to a specific application domain by extracting a specialized grammar from the original one using a large set of training examples .
3596,3,The sources of complexity uncovered here are thus a forteriori present in all these richer systems as well .
3597,3,The logarithm with ` + ' is defined to be 0 for an argument less than 1 .
3598,3,o is the type of a meta-level proposition _comma_ and so the intended usage of apply is to take three arguments of type tm _comma_ where the first should be an object-level  - abstraction _comma_ and set the third equal to the application of the first to the second .
3599,4,SRs have been used to express semantic constraints holding in different syntactic and functional configurations .
3600,3,There are two other ordering operators based on general ordering principles : the local focus principle and the proof time order principle Huang 1994b .
3601,3,To complete the scheme _comma_ it is necessary to define the similarity metric and _comma_ accordingly _comma_  and .
3602,1,We developed a compiler for off-line optimization of phrase structure rule-based typed feature structure grammars which generalizes the techniques developed in the context of the DIA _comma_ and we advanced a typed extension of the Earley-style generator of Gerdemann 1991 .
3603,3,Thus ` A _comma_ B ' indicates that A precedes B in the input _comma_ perhaps with some intervening material .
3604,3,The values of  _comma_ and t are the best ones found for each k .
3605,5,It is even possible for sentences started by one dialogue participant to be finished by another .
3606,3,In the next experiment we evaluated whether the morphological rules add any improvement if they are used in conjunction with the ending-guessing rules .
3607,3,It is also possible that A intends that BY saying u _comma_ which realizes p _comma_ B should make a certain inference q. Then B 's understanding of u should include B making this inference .
3608,3,It happens because erroneous senses _comma_ metonymies _comma_ ... _comma_ accumulate evidence for the higher class .
3609,3,Even if a sentence receives no complete analysis _comma_ it is likely to contain some parsable substrings ; results from these are recorded together with their position within the input .
3610,3,The superior performance of this model confirms results presented by Briscoe et al. 1994 _comma_ Merialdo 1994 _comma_ and Elworthy 1994 for English : empirically obtained initial values for transition and output probabilities with a small number of training iterations lead to significantly better results than intuitively generated biases do .
3611,3,But now _comma_ the location time of the eventuality in the subordinate clause serves as the antecedent for the location time of the eventuality in the main clause .
3612,3,Here _comma_ two unattached lexical items have been identified _comma_ together with two instances of rule 4 _comma_ which combines a NP with a postmodifying PP .
3613,3,Since F is a group _comma_  by the uniqueness of solution .
3614,4,The process to identify word boundaries is usually called segmentation .
3615,3,We regard Paradigme as a field for the interaction between text and episodes in memory -- the interaction between what one is hearing or reading and what one knows Schank 1990 .
3616,3,Two problem classes for defaults in the incremental syntactic generator VM-GEN are presented to substantiate our discussion .
3617,5,In the Montagovian tradition _comma_ semantic representations are compositionally generated in correspondence with the constituent modification relationships manifest in the syntax ; predicates are curried .
3618,3,The connectives ` _comma_ ' and ` ; ' have the same precedence as in Prolog _comma_ while ` : ' has the same precedence as ` _comma_ ' .
3619,5,The universal a priori probability has many elegant properties _comma_ the most salient of which is that it dominates all other enumerable probability distributions multiplicatively .
3620,3,Let  _comma_
3621,3,They have an eminently procedural character _comma_ and there is no obvious way to handle this idea in the present set up .
3622,3,It is by no means generally accepted that such a classification is linguistically adequate .
3623,7,in which situations defaults are applied ( see section  ) _comma_
3624,3,Suppose available to us are data like those in Figure  _comma_ which are frequency data ( co-occurrence data ) between verbs and their objects extracted from a corpus ( step ) .
3625,5,For smoothing _comma_ we combine the expansion distribution of each symbol with a uniform distribution _comma_ that is _comma_ we take the smoothed parameter  to be
3626,3,Second the assumption that propositions representing beliefs and intentions get added to the context by the unilateral action of one conversant must be dropped .
3627,3,If one looks at the order-sensitive nature of the operations of semantic compositions _comma_ they provide a poor starting point for a treatment of semantics enjoying similar computational success .
3628,3,Perfect training is represented by case D0 + T0 .
3629,3,The extensions can be summarized as follows :
3630,3,The biases in the model consisted for the most part in specifications of the most plausible successor tags for each tag in the tag set .
3631,3,Instead _comma_ two distinct factors have been separated out : the resolution of missing constituents under Common Topic inference is purely syntactic whereas the resolution of anaphoric expressions in all cases is purely semantic ; the apparent dichotomy in VP-ellipsis data arises out of the interaction between these different phenomena .
3632,2,Secondly _comma_ extending the model may greatly increase the amount of training data required if sparseness problems are to be kept under control _comma_ and additional data may be unavailable or expensive to collect .
3633,3,Due to the `` context-freeness '' of PLPATR _comma_ new entries can be added to the compatibility array in a bottom-up manner based on existing entries without the need to reconstruct complete feature structures .
3634,5,This inflexibility of Lambek Calculus is one of the reasons why many researchers study richer systems today .
3635,4,In such cases _comma_ the speaker has the goal of having the hearer know how to identify an object .
3636,3,We assume that agents generally plan their actions to violate as few rules as possible _comma_ and so obligated actions will usually occur .
3637,3,In each case _comma_ arguments to coherence relations take the form of semantic representations retrieved by way of their corresponding node ( s ) in the syntax ; the operations performed on these representations are dictated by the nature of the constraints imposed .
3638,3,We developed a simple _comma_ extremely compact and efficient guesser for French .
3639,3,The second split then further refines the weaponry sense into a projectile sense ( cluster 3 ) and a gun sense ( cluster 4 ) .
3640,3,PLAN QUALITY :
3641,5,In commonly used models _comma_ the probability estimate for a previously unseen cooccurrence is a function of the probability estimates for the words in the cooccurrence .
3642,5,In example  _comma_ attributed to Paul Dekker _comma_ the two conjuncts require Mary 's handbag to have a different syntactic structure : the bracketing appropriate for the first conjunct is [ [ a friend of Mary ] 's handbag ] .
3643,5,Language models expressed as a probabilistic grammar tend to be more compact than n-gram language models _comma_ and have the ability to model long-distance dependencies Lari and Young 1990 _comma_ Resnik 1992 _comma_ Schabes 1992 .
3644,3,For each  _comma_ each and each _comma_ is defined _comma_ and iff _comma_ and for some _comma_ .
3645,3,Thus the most frequent words had the greatest influence on the aggreagte measures .
3646,1,We have demonstrated that a general divisive clustering procedure for probability distributions can be used to group words according to their participation in particular grammatical relations with other words .
3647,4,If the system is not able to give a preference for one of the alternatives _comma_ e.g. _comma_ by evaluating context information _comma_ the generator has to choose a probable number value on its own to complete verbalization .
3648,2,However _comma_ this approach does not fully capture the sense in which inhibitory factors play a negative and not just a neutral role .
3649,3,While using windowed co-occurrence did not help here _comma_ it is possible that under more data sparse conditions better performance could be achieved by this method .
3650,2,Thirdly _comma_ one cannot always know in advance of doing the work whether extending a model in a particular direction will _comma_ in practice _comma_ improve results .
3651,3,We sketch algorithms allowing the numerical parameters of our probabilistic interpretations of HPSG to be estimated from corpora .
3652,3,Therefore _comma_ we can write  _comma_ and by a result we showed above _comma_ .
3653,1,We present such linguistic investigations on French motion verbs and spatial prepositions and the basic concepts we have found .
3654,3,In fact _comma_ as can be seen from Figure  _comma_ before copying takes place there is no sentence-level semantics for gapped clauses at all .
3655,3,Each feature for a major category is assigned a unique position in the compiled Prolog term _comma_ and features for which finite value sets have been specified are compiled into vectors in a form that allows boolean expressions _comma_ involving negation as well as conjunction and disjunction _comma_ to be conjoined by unification Mellish 1988 _comma_ Alshawi 1992 .
3656,3,Namely _comma_ since we use semantic / pragmatic roles instead of grammatical roles in constraints _comma_ our constraints can account for zero anaphora in a sentence where the main clause is passive where an agent or an experiencer is not necessarily the subject _comma_ like the following example .
3657,3,adjacency constraints may be imposed between RHS clauses ;
3658,3,This is true on the abstract level as well _comma_ since there will be nodes in the description which precede the original low position of the relative clause _comma_ but are dominated by the subsequent high position of the relative clause .
3659,3,You simply cannot explore the consequences of doing something one way rather than another _comma_ or of combining an analysis of this with an analysis of that _comma_ unless activities such as compositional construction and subsequent  - reduction of interpretations is done for you by machine .
3660,3,We have followed the same approach with French spatial prepositions _comma_ but using a structuration of the space induced by the location introduced in the PP by the preposition _comma_ and not induced by the lref as for verbs .
3661,5,In effect _comma_ an arbitrary permutation of signs is input to a shift-reduce parser which tests them for grammatical well-formedness .
3662,5,The distance vector of a word can be considered to be a list of the activation strengths at the origin nodes when the word node is activated .
3663,3,we compare our results with similar works in course of realization on the Basquian language ( by Michel Aurnague ) and on the Japanese language ( by Junichi Saito ) ;
3664,3,The LF therefore determines the accuracy of translations _comma_ which may be impoverished due to the generalised nature of basic LFs .
3665,3,Then _comma_ the problematic final word ` - aseru ( causative ) ' arrives ; its DAG representation is as in Fig.  .
3666,3,In this way _comma_ if w and w ' have comparable frequencies but w ' has a sharper context distribution than w _comma_ then  is greater than .
3667,3,This final information was contained neither in the verb or in the preposition .
3668,3,The notion of obligation has been studied for many centuries _comma_ and its formal aspects are examined using Deontic Logic .
3669,4,Extract co-occurrence data ( e.g. case frame data _comma_ adjacency data ) from a corpus _comma_
3670,3,Similarly  _comma_ since .
3671,3,This study identifies surface linguistic phenomena which reflect the fact that participants are continuously monitoring their goals .
3672,3,Summaries appear to have an additional function of synchronization _comma_ by allowing both participants to agree on what propositions are mutually believed at that point in the discussion .
3673,3,It can be glossed as follows .
3674,4,In essence _comma_ pairs of trees are just a graphical notation for what has been put forward as the ` rule-to-rule ' - hypothesis _comma_ cf. Gazdar et al. 1985 _comma_ the fact that in the grammar each syntax rule is related with a semantic analysis rule .
3675,4,a meaning language and
3676,5,However _comma_ each essentially follows Sag in requiring that elided VP representations be alphabetic variants of their referents .
3677,5,In Ohye 1975 _comma_ it is said that if garu is used in a subordinate clause _comma_ the subject of the main clause is not the experiencer of the subordinate clause .
3678,3,Relations between path sets are represented explicitly as resources in the logic by R-relations .
3679,3,The best level for stating the SR is not the one induced _comma_ but a lower one .
3680,4,In narrative sequences _comma_ event clauses seem to advance the narrative time _comma_ while states block its progression .
3681,3,This might include _comma_ for instance _comma_ phrases of the form a slightly dipping line .
3682,3,We have realized a systematic and fine linguistic study on these verbs _comma_ looking carefully at each of them _comma_ one by one ( and we have 440 CoL verbs in French ) _comma_ in order to extract their intrinsic spatiotemporal properties .
3683,3,control phases ;
3684,3,The quantitative language and translation models are based on relations between lexical heads of phrases .
3685,3,We tagged several texts of different origins _comma_ except from the Brown Corpus .
3686,5,Several similar attempts can be found in previous work .
3687,3,For French the major ambiguity types are :
3688,3,This may require an adjustment of the similarity based estimate _comma_ possibly along the lines of Rosenfeld and Huang 1992 .
3689,2,In Gorrell 's model _comma_ `` unconscious '' garden paths may be processed via the addition of structural relations to a monotone increasing set at the point of disambiguation _comma_ but there is no discussion as to how the parser decides which relations to add .
3690,3,This state is appropriate as the initial state for a parse of both directly _comma_ or of after 3 pm through my secretary _comma_ resulting in a final state of category sentence .
3691,3,This picks precisely those models in which all the tree nodes are appropriately licensed .
3692,3,Since most natural language rules are not absolute _comma_ the disambiguation criteria discovered in this work are never applied deterministically .
3693,5,The result is therefore similar to starting with the sentence :
3694,1,not requiring order-sensitive interleaving of different resolution operations _comma_ and
3695,3,The nodes  and share the tree _comma_ which occurs twice at the node .
3696,7,We will briefly discuss these models _comma_ before we describe our own .
3697,2,Even though these approaches often accomplish considerable improvements with respect to efficiency or termination behavior _comma_ it remains unclear how these optimizations relate to each other and what comprises the logic behind these specialized forms of filtering .
3698,1,In particular we will concentrate on how we might the calculation of the intersection of a FSA and a DCG .
3699,6,The Design-World environment is based on a cognitive model of limited attention and supports experiments on the interaction of discourse strategies with agents ' cognitive limitations .
3700,3,grammars are too complex and detailed to develop manually for most interesting domains ;
3701,3,An alternative that is often used is to limit the possible tags using a simple morphological analysis or some other examination of the surface form of the word .
3702,3,This collection includes the grammatical functions ( e.g. subj _comma_ obj _comma_ iobj ) together with some longer transitions such as obl ; obj and to ; obj .
3703,3,In other words _comma_ c is a scoped constant and the current signature gets expanded with c for the proof of [ c / x ] G. Since c is meant to be treated as a generic placeholder for any arbitrary x of the proper type _comma_ c must not appear in any terms instantiated for logic variables during the proof of [ c / x ] G .
3704,3,The example we use to illustrate the algorithm is in figure  .
3705,2,To evaluate our algorithm _comma_ we compare the performance of our algorithm to that of n-gram models and the Inside-Outside algorithm .
3706,5,Conversational action is represented using the theory of Conversation Acts Traum and Hinkelman 1992 which augments traditional Core Speech Acts with levels of acts for turn-taking _comma_ grounding Clark and Schaefer 1989 _comma_ and argumentation .
3707,3,the outside of proximity ;
3708,4,From the practical point of view _comma_ word classification addresses questions of data sparseness and generalization in statistical language models _comma_ particularly models for deciding among alternative analyses proposed by a grammar .
3709,3,These rules are applied to the conceptual representation and their output is a set of candidate antecedents .
3710,4,Collaborative negotiation occurs when conflicts arise among agents developing a shared plan during collaborative planning .
3711,3,The accuracy of this method is about 80 % .
3712,3,Now _comma_ suppose that  and are tone sequences and that _comma_ and .
3713,3,For example _comma_ the CCG category for a transitive verb  would be represented as .
3714,3,Therefore _comma_ they lack linguistic clues and the system cannot extract the rhetorical structure exactly .
3715,3,Therefore _comma_ if the apprentice needs to make a contribution _comma_ s / he must do so via interruption _comma_ explaining why there are many more interruptions in these dialogues .
3716,1,A variety of statistical methods for noun compound analysis are implemented and compared .
3717,3,We proceed as in the case without re-entrancy _comma_ except that we only ever expand sub-trees in the case where the new node begins a new equivalence class .
3718,3,The other use is that the existence or otherwise of an improvement brought about by clustering can be a good indicator of whether additional performance can in fact be gained by extending the model by hand without further data collection _comma_ with the possibly considerable additional effort that extension would entail .
3719,5,Propose any NP or S node encountered as the antecedent .
3720,5,There are several researches that are attacking this problem .
3721,3,The fact that each string received multiple parses ( the mean number of analyses being 9.135 _comma_ and the median _comma_ 6 ) suggests that the probabilistic information did favourably guide the selection of a single analysis .
3722,3,We expect it to increase the coverage of thesuffix morphological rules and hence contribute to the overall guessing accuracy .
3723,3,Instantiating the lexical entries for Bill _comma_ NAFTA _comma_ and supported according to the labels on the f-structure in  _comma_ we obtain the following premises :
3724,5,He examined the process of learning the grammar of a formal language from examples .
3725,3,This suggests that the predictive power of neighbors beyond the closest 30 or so can be modeled fairly well by the overall frequency of the conditioned word .
3726,3,The most important ones are that the Brown Corpus provides a model of general multi-domain language use _comma_ so general language regularities can be induced from it _comma_ and second _comma_ many taggers come with data trained on the Brown Corpus which is useful for comparison and evaluation .
3727,5,The principal contribution of this work is to separate the effect of the lexical and transition parameters of the model _comma_ and to show how the results vary with different degree of similarity between the training and test data .
3728,3,Furthermore _comma_ it enables a reduction of the number of edges that need to be stored through unfolding magic predicates .
3729,3,Islands do not overlap _comma_ although when multiple analyses exist they will in general involve different segmentations of the input into islands .
3730,3,In the current implementation of LHIP _comma_ compiled rules are interpreted depth-first and left-to-right by the standard Prolog theorem-prover _comma_ giving an analyser that proceeds in a top-down _comma_ ` left-head-corner ' fashion .
3731,3,SVD addresses the problems of generalization and sparseness because broad and stable generalizations are represented on dimensions with large values which will be retained in the dimensionality reduction .
3732,2,The fundamental problem in both cases is that the concept of free and bound occurrences of variables is not supported by Prolog _comma_ but instead needs to be implemented by additional programming .
3733,3,Instead _comma_ the only information about the objects is the statistics of their joint appearance .
3734,3,We also gain efficiency since we can manipulate smaller vectors _comma_ reduced to 50 dimensions .
3735,3,SRs are only acquired if there are enough cases in the corpus as to gather statistical evidence .
3736,3,Suppose we have two tone sequences  and _comma_ and two interpretation functions and based on R and R ' respectively .
3737,4,The f-structure for sentence  is given in :
3738,3,where index Y stands for the head _comma_ and each of the random variables  represents a case slot .
3739,3,This binary string must represent not only the lexical entries _comma_ their indices ( called code words ) and the coded sample _comma_ but also overhead information specifying the number of items coded and their arrangement in the string ( information implicitly given by spacing and spatial placement in the introductory examples ) .
3740,4,But several questions are raised that are less easily answered .
3741,1,Our working prototype indicates that the methods described here are worth developing _comma_ and that connectionist methods can be used to generalise from the training corpus to unseen text .
3742,5,Another benefit from the method is a decreased error rate when the system is required to select a preferred analysis .
3743,2,While these techniques can yield significant improvements in performance _comma_ the generality of unification-based grammar formalisms means that there are still cases where expensive processing is unavoidable .
3744,4,An analysis of the mechanism of temporal anaphoric reference hinges upon an understanding of the ontological and logical foundations of temporal reference .
3745,2,How should a word like `` plant '' be categorized if it has uses both as a verb and as a noun ?
3746,3,We can then avoid generating the structures until higher-level information can be applied to complete the disambiguation process .
3747,5,Finally _comma_ the acquired SRs are more independent of the lexical choices made in the training corpus .
3748,3,the brackets `` ) '' and `` ( '' .
3749,3,It is shown that existing parsing algorithms can be easily extended for FSA inputs .
3750,2,Therefore the property sharing theory also fails to account for the intuitive interpretations .
3751,7,This is followed by some examples of sentences translated by the proposed method and a discussion of the results .
3752,3,This shows the length of the links between words W  in Fig. _comma_ where N denotes the total number of links from and to W and n denotes the number of direct links between these two words .
3753,2,The problem with using automatically derived categories is that even if they are in a sense real _comma_ meaning that they are supported by data _comma_ they may be difficult to explain for the unenthusiastic layman if the aim is to use the technique in retrieval tools .
3754,3,Joe 's statement is based on his prior beliefs .
3755,5,The MDL Principle is a well-motivated and theoretically sound principle for data compression and estimation in information theory and statistics .
3756,3,Another source of information which is used and which is not prepared specially for the task is a text corpus .
3757,3,The configuration of four R values that we find when  is not downstepped or upstepped ( the first two columns ) is reproduced in the columns for downstep ( multiplied by d ) and in the columns for upstep ( divided by d ) .
3758,3,To use an example from the previous section _comma_ category #590 ( `` Writing '' ) contains the following :
3759,4,In natural language processing filtering is used to weed out those search paths that are redundant _comma_ i.e. _comma_ are not going to be used in the proof tree corresponding to the natural language expression to be generated or parsed .
3760,3,If  then we say that is satisfied in at n .
3761,3,However _comma_ as the evaluation below shows _comma_ good values for  are small _comma_ that is _comma_ the similarity-based model plays a stronger role than the independence assumption .
3762,3,Thus _comma_ `` generalized coordination '' _comma_ instead of being a family of separate rules _comma_ can be expressed as a single rule on recursive descent through logical forms .
3763,2,Note that van Noord 's method is restricted to grammars where phrases have always a lexical semantic head .
3764,3,To enhance the performance of the robust parser for extragrammatical sentences _comma_ we proposed several heuristics .
3765,6,Since these structures are the ones which are used in by Pollard and Sag 1994 their relevance to computational grammars is apparent .
3766,3,We give some definitions _comma_ state some key assumptions about suitable TNCBs for generation _comma_ and then describe the algorithm itself .
3767,1,In this paper _comma_ we describe aspects of this work concerned with the definition of the tagset _comma_ the building of the lexicon _comma_ derived from an existing two-level morphological analyser _comma_ and the definition of a lexical transducer for guessing unknown words .
3768,3,To obtain the required sequence U _comma_ we simply choose for the  terminals the type ( resp .
3769,3,Finally _comma_ the task determines whether there are penalties for leaving a warrant implicit and relying on B to infer or retrieve it .
3770,5,Despite the large amount of theoretical work done on non-constituent coordination during the last two decades _comma_ many computational systems still treat coordination using adapted parsing strategies _comma_ in a similar fashion to the SYSCONJ system developed for ATNs .
3771,3,I write  for .
3772,1,These parameters - languages with a complex morphology / syntax interface but a limited number of affix combinations _comma_ tasks where the lexicon is not necessarily known at compile time _comma_ bidirectional processing _comma_ and the need to ease development rather than optimize run-time efficiency - dictate the design of the morphology compiler described in this paper _comma_ in which spelling rules and possible affix combinations ( items  and ) _comma_ but not the lexicon ( item ) _comma_ are composed in the compilation phase .
3773,5,The evaluation process attempts to find an instantiation of the variables such that all of the constraints are satisfied and the mental actions executable with respect to the hearer 's beliefs about the speaker 's beliefs .
3774,5,Indeed _comma_ Groenendijk and Stokhof claim that the compositional nature of Dynamic Predicate Logic enables one to `` interpret a text in an on-line manner _comma_ i.e. _comma_ incrementally _comma_ processing and interpreting each basic unit as it comes along _comma_ in the context created by the interpretation of the text so far '' .
3775,3,As implied here _comma_ rules need not cover all of the input in order to succeed .
3776,3,An argument can be made that the approach taken here relies on a formalism that entails implementation issues that are more difficult than for the other solutions and inherently not as efficient .
3777,5,This is the case for the semantic analysis rules of certain constraint-based semantic representations _comma_ e.g. Underspecified Discourse Representation Structures ( UDRSs ) Frank and Reyle 1992 .
3778,5,For example _comma_ the Penn treebank tagset Marcus et al. 1993 omits a number of the distinctions which are made in the LOB and Brown tagsets on which it is based Garside et al. 1987 _comma_ Francis and Kucera 1992 in cases where the surface form of the words allows the distinctions to be recovered if they are needed .
3779,3,The lexicon used in this implementation was derived from Lingsoft 's GERTWOL morphological analyzer _comma_ which uses finite state transducers _comma_ by mapping the morpho-syntactic labels generated by GERTWOL onto the ELWIS tag set .
3780,3,We found shifts of attentional state when shifts in control are negotiated and agreed by all participants _comma_ but not when control is seized by one participant without the acceptance of the others .
3781,5,can be given a semantics as a function from entities to truth values i.e.  x. likes ( john _comma_ x ) _comma_ without having to say that John likes is a constituent .
3782,5,Magic compilation does not limit the information that can be used for filtering .
3783,3,At present there is a limited implementation _comma_ which performs a mapping from sentence fragments to fully scoped logical representations .
3784,5,In the original Good -Turing method Good 1953 the free probability mass is redistributed uniformly among all unseen events .
3785,3,We chose  to give equal weight to precision and recall .
3786,3,A signature provides the symbols from which to construct typed feature structures _comma_ and an interpretation gives those symbols meaning .
3787,3,This way of following the intended semantic dependencies the dependency constraint is satisfied automatically for a large class of grammars .
3788,2,It is shown that combining off-line techniques with an advanced Earley-style generator provides an elegant solution to the general problem that empty or displaced heads pose for conventional head-driven generation .
3789,2,If it turns out not to _comma_ considerable ingenuity and effort may have been wasted .
3790,3,However _comma_ State-Prediction can also apply _comma_ and can be instantiated in four ways ( these correspond to different ways of cutting up the left and right subcategorisation lists of the lexical entry _comma_ likes _comma_ i.e. as  np or np ) .
3791,3,As evidence for these claims _comma_ I present experimental results showing how _comma_ for a particular task and training corpus _comma_ clustering produces a sizeable improvement in unigram - and bigram-based models _comma_ but not in trigram-based ones ; this is consistent with experience in the speech understanding community that while moving from bigrams to trigrams usually produces a definite payoff _comma_ a move from trigrams to 4-grams yields less clear benefits for the domain in question .
3792,3,for each  _comma_ each and each _comma_ if and then _comma_
3793,3,On the contrary _comma_ it is the result of a complex interaction between these properties .
3794,3,It is less brittle because statistical associations have replaced constraints ( featural _comma_ selectional _comma_ etc. ) that must be satisfied exactly .
3795,3,This quantification structure does not need to be stipulated as part of the Q-adverb 's meaning _comma_ but arises directly from the temporal system .
3796,3,( one must apply the knowledge that Austrians speak German to correctly interpret the ellipsis ) .
3797,2,More importantly _comma_ for some sites information may be lacking _comma_ or the question is simply not applicable .
3798,5,The system repeats the process until it can find no more goals to adopt _comma_ at which time it switches back to being the hearer and waits for a response from the other copy .
3799,3,Similarity is computed by spreading activation ( or association ) Waltz and Pollack 1985 on a semantic network constructed systematically from an English dictionary .
3800,3,In particular _comma_ nothing requires that a head of a rule should share any information with the LHS item _comma_ although in practice it often will .
3801,7,Then we present the extension of this algorithm _comma_ and the heuristics adopted by the robust parser .
3802,4,A speaker cannot simply assume that a proposal or an assertion will be accepted .
3803,3,So _comma_ far _comma_ we have looked at two kinds of measurements of model quality :
3804,3,It has been claimed that these advantages arise from viewing semantic interpretation as a process of building descriptions of semantic compositions .
3805,3,Table  shows reductions in training and test perplexity _comma_ sorted by training reduction _comma_ for different choices in the number k of closest neighbors used .
3806,3,Table  shows some examples of speech recognition disagreements between the two models .
3807,3,Let  and be the path sequences through the tree corresponding to t and t ' respectively _comma_ and let and be the path sequences through the feature structure corresponding to f and f ' respectively .
3808,3,quantitative preference based on probabilistic derivation and translation ;
3809,5,We rank the items in Cf by obliqueness of grammatical relation of the subcategorized functions of the main verb : that is _comma_ first the subject _comma_ object _comma_ and object 2 _comma_ followed by other subcategorized functions _comma_ and finally _comma_ adjuncts .
3810,3,In the process of learning SRs _comma_ the system needs to know how words are clustered in semantic classes _comma_ and how semantic classes are hierarchically organized .
3811,5,The parsers create parse forests Tomita 1987 that incorporate subtree sharing ( in which identical sub-analyses are shared between differing superordinate analyses ) and node packing ( where sub-analyses covering the same portion of input whose root categories are in a subsumption relationship are merged into a single node ) .
3812,5,On the one hand _comma_ statistically meaningful data can be gathered from ( relatively ) small corpora _comma_ and not only for the most frequent words .
3813,3,In this case the anaphora module can be applied before the attachment procedure .
3814,3,affirm that the suggestion was used _comma_ along with additional attributes that weren't suggested _comma_ by using s-affirm and s-actions ; or
3815,3,This information is the result of the interaction of the verb sortir-to go out with the preposition dans-in / into .
3816,5,Litman and Allen described a model in which a discourse structure of conversation was built by recognizing a participant 's plans Litman and Allen 1987 .
3817,4,Texts about certain topics may only occur in certain genres _comma_ and texts in certain genres may only treat certain topics ; most topics do _comma_ however _comma_ occur in several genres _comma_ which is what interests us here .
3818,3,based on information explicitly provided in the dialogue or _comma_
3819,4,To speed data entry _comma_ the user usually enters the base characters ( say a paragraph ) and then goes back and enters the diacritics .
3820,3,We cannot trust the results of a quantitative evaluation without doing a considerable amount of qualitative analyses and we should perform our qualitative analyses on those components that make a significant contribution to the quantitative results ; we need to be able to measure the effect of various factors .
3821,5,X  Y X Conj Y
3822,5,They replace isoglosses with a distance matrix _comma_ which compares each site directly with all other sites _comma_ ultimately yielding a single figure that measures the linguistic distances between each pair of sites .
3823,3,To measure the accuracy of the tagger _comma_ we compare the chosen tag with one provided by a human annotator .
3824,3,incremental and / or partial specification of the content of utterances _comma_ particularly useful in translation ;
3825,6,We apply MDL to the problem of estimating a model consisting of a pair of partitions as described above .
3826,3,The temporal clause may be processed before the main clause _comma_ since t ' _comma_ the location time of e ' _comma_ which ` replaces '  _comma_ the reference time of Partee 's analysis _comma_ as the temporal index of the eventuality in the the main clause _comma_ arises from processing the main clause ( not updating the reference time of the subordinate clause ) .
3827,3,Only a very few symbol biases were defined before evaluation of the first training runs _comma_ mainly to reflect biases towards equivalence classes used in the class guesser .
3828,2,Thus _comma_ although Lakoff and Peters 's arguments count against standard deletion analyses _comma_ they do not count as general arguments against a unified treatment of constituent and non-constituent coordination .
3829,1,In particular _comma_ we propose a method of learning dependencies between case frame slots .
3830,3,where ``  '' means `` not token identical . ''
3831,5,It has been noted in previous work that the felicity of certain forms of ellipsis is dependent on the type of coherence relationship extant between the antecedent and elided clauses Levin and Prince 1982 _comma_ Kehler 1993b .
3832,3,If an agent actually violates obligations as well then the agent can be held accountable .
3833,3,The latter dimension -- syntactic process -- will be treated as a film projected dynamically onto Paradigme .
3834,3,Morphemes are represented in braces _comma_ { } _comma_ surface ( phonological ) forms in solidi _comma_ / / _comma_ and orthographic strings in acute brackets _comma_   .
3835,4,In standard information theoretic terms _comma_ both  and are REDUNDANT .
3836,3,This allows us to employ a greedy algorithm to refine the structure progressively until either a target constituent is found and generation has succeeded or no more changes can be made and generation has failed .
3837,3,This empirical finding verifies the independence assumption widely made in practice in statistical natural language processing .
3838,2,We are developing an alternate approach that takes a step back from the strong plan-based approach .
3839,3,As things stand this definition is nearly isomorphic to that given for PCFGs _comma_ with the major differences being two changes which move us from rules to introduction relationships .
3840,3,Then _comma_ normalize thickness of the links as  _comma_ in each .
3841,3,Now we define  if H _comma_ H and if L _comma_ L .
3842,5,One of the promising candidate for this is the centering theory Brennan et al. 1987 _comma_ Walker 1990 .
3843,3,Implementing a new language model for this tagger involves supplying :
3844,3,how the representation is mapped from one language to another ;
3845,6,All the analyses in this paper were produced _comma_ and  - reduced ( and turned into LaTeX ! ) _comma_ by a version of the system described in Ramsay 1992a .
3846,3,Mental actions in the intermediate plans of a referring expression plan allow the speaker to choose the most salient attributes that have not yet been chosen _comma_ and constraints in the surface speech actions make sure the speaker believes that each attribute is true .
3847,3,But all of these tasks will be greatly facilitated by a quick and accurate grouping of the dialects .
3848,3,In addition _comma_ feedback is given to the grammar writer on the degree to which the grammar is able to cope with the given input ; in a context of grammar development _comma_ this may serve as notification of areas to which the coverage of the grammar might next be extended .
3849,3,The basic VM-GEN module provides repair strategies in order to allow for the specification of additions _comma_ modifications and deletions of input increments _comma_ i.e. _comma_ to model a flexible input interface .
3850,3,However _comma_ this is not the end of the story .
3851,3,The possible temporal / rhetorical relations are constrained .
3852,2,This increases the computational complexity of the ellipsis resolution task .
3853,3,With the threshold level set to 0 _comma_ all analyses possible with the grammar by deletion of input terminals can be generated .
3854,3,For example _comma_ the following query
3855,4,The type of compilation appropriate for rapid development and acceptable run-time performance depends on _comma_ at least _comma_ the nature of the language being described and the number of base forms in the lexicon ; that is _comma_ on the position in the three-dimensional space defined by  _comma_ and .
3856,3,The texts used for training and as a reference for evaluation were the same as the ones used in the implementation described in section  .
3857,4,Coordination of this kind is traditionally split into constituent coordination _comma_ where each conjunct forms a constituent according to ` standard ' phrase structure grammars _comma_ and non-constituent coordination .
3858,3,We assume that the first sentence has been processed _comma_ and concentrate on processing the fragment .
3859,4,So _comma_ first words are looked up in the lexicon .
3860,2,However _comma_ using the co-occurrence statistics requires a huge corpus that covers even most rare words .
3861,4,To demonstrate our approach we will address the following examples ; passages  - are taken from Lascarides and Asher 1993 .
3862,3,Regardless of the criterion for success _comma_ the algorithm does need further evaluation .
3863,3,While the order in which composition operations are performed can radically affect the outcome _comma_ the order in which descriptions are built up is unimportant .
3864,3,Using these training data three types of guessing rules are learned : prefix morphological rules _comma_ suffix morphological rules and ending-guessing rules .
3865,3,To decide what suggestion to make _comma_ the agent uses an instance of suggest-expand-plan _comma_ which has a mental action in its decomposition that chooses the attribute that he believes is the most salient that has not been used already .
3866,3,An especially interesting feature of MDL is that it incorporates the input data size in its model selection criterion .
3867,4,The warrant in  was included despite the fact that it was common knowledge among the conversants .
3868,6,The account proposed here of how the COMMON GROUND is augmented _comma_ is based is Lewis 's SHARED ENVIRONMENT model for common knowledge Lewis 1969 _comma_ Clark and Marshall 1981 .
3869,3,Its novel features are that it treats tense _comma_ aspect _comma_ temporal adverbials and rhetorical relations as mutually constraining ; it postulates less ambiguity than current temporal structuring algorithms do ; and it uses semantic closeness and other preference techniques rather than full-fledged world knowledge postulates to determine preferences over remaining ambiguities .
3870,2,Furthermore _comma_ their system deals with a single conflict _comma_ while our model selects a focus in its pursuit of conflict resolution when multiple conflicts arise .
3871,4,A collaborative agent is driven by the goal of developing a plan that best satisfies the interests of all the agents as a group _comma_ instead of one that maximizes his own interest .
3872,3,Rare words are difficult because of lack of distributional evidence .
3873,3,Since our goal is to correctly segment speech _comma_ accuracy is more important than finding every correct segmentation .
3874,3,These probabilities are estimated using statistical decision tree models .
3875,3,Finally _comma_ we deal with sentences such as  _comma_ which contain an iteration of an implicit generic quantifier and always .
3876,3,The counts used in this model and in ours were obtained from 40.5 million words of WSJ text from the years 1987 - 89 .
3877,3,This problem is the starting-point for the following considerations .
3878,4,It tends to be the case usually that a simpler model has a poorer fit to the data _comma_ and a more complex model has a better fit to the data .
3879,6,( There is a variety of neighborhood definitions such as `` 100 surrounding words '' Yarowsky 1992 and `` within a distance of no more than 3 words ignoring function words '' Dagan et al. 1993 . )
3880,3,For trigrams _comma_ it is necessary to measure similarity between different conditioning bigrams .
3881,3,First consider the notion of evidence .
3882,2,However _comma_ this does not explain why the use of the simple past is perfectly coherent when the Explanation relationship is indicated overtly as it is in sentence  _comma_ nor do they adequately explain why CCT must be satisfied for this causal law and not for those supporting similar examples for which they successfully infer an unsignaled Explanation relation ( see discussion of example _comma_ pg. 463 ) .
3883,4,Agents involved in collaborative negotiation are open and honest with one another ; they will not deliberately present false information to other agents _comma_ present information in such a way as to mislead the other agents _comma_ or strategically hold back information from other agents for later use .
3884,7,In the following paragraphs we describe the functional specification of the system .
3885,3,The top-down presentation operators are roughly divided into two categories :
3886,3,describes a state _comma_ or
3887,2,In the central role of heads _comma_ LHIP resembles parsers devised by Kay 1989 and van Noord 1991 ; in other respects _comma_ including the use which is made of heads _comma_ the approaches are rather different _comma_ however .
3888,3,We now define each of these components .
3889,3,We also examined how utterance type related to topic shift and found that few interruptions introduced a new topic .
3890,5,For a system to generate self repairs might also require incremental interpretation _comma_ assuming a process where the system performs on-line monitoring of its output ( akin to Levelt 's model of the human self-repair mechanism ) .
3891,5,Since then the original tag set was redefined _comma_ making the tagged corpus used to train the LIKELY tagger obsolete .
3892,3,doesn't describe an activity and describes a past perfect stative .
3893,3,We satisfy the goal of favoring smaller grammars by choosing a prior that assigns higher probabilities to such grammars .
3894,5,is the highest-ranked element of that is realized in .
3895,3,Consider  :
3896,3,If Explanation (A_comma_B) then  .
3897,1,We have given an account of temporal relations whereby
3898,3,These links _comma_ called discourse relations _comma_ are basic concepts on which texts are structured Asher 1993 .
3899,3,For example _comma_ after parsing You can call me one possible state is a sentence missing a sentence modifier .
3900,3,We selected then the subset involving the 1000 most frequent nouns in the corpus for clustering _comma_ and randomly divided it into a training set of 756721 pairs and a test set of 81240 pairs .
3901,5,Each of the three operations have both a forward and backward variant .
3902,3,Segmentation detects rhetorical expressions between distant sentences which define rhetorical structure .
3903,3,for each  _comma_
3904,3,Precision is the number of correct tokens divided by the sum of correct and incorrect tokens .
3905,7,Examples are provided in sections  and .
3906,3,Having a definition for  _comma_ we could use it directly as in the back-off scheme .
3907,3,Using the non-Curried notation of Bar-Hillel _comma_ it is more natural to use a separate wh-list than to mark wh-arguments individually .
3908,3,Table  demonstrates some results of this experiment .
3909,5,Finally _comma_ processing of the hat refines the set to rabbits which are in a hat .
3910,3,To be coherent _comma_ utterances within a discourse segment require more than is embodied in their individual syntactic and semantic representations alone ; additional inter-utterance constraints must be met .
3911,3,A heuristic word-based method for disambiguation _comma_ in which the random variables ( case slots ) are assumed to be dependent _comma_ is to calculate the following values of word-based likelihood and to select the interpretation corresponding to the higher likelihood value .
3912,3,The guesser is thus based on productive endings ( like ment for adverbs _comma_ ible for adjectives _comma_ er for verbs ) .
3913,3,From equation  _comma_ it is clear that the computational cost of applying the similarity model to an unseen bigram is O(k) .
3914,5,and a single combination rule schema which states that _comma_
3915,5,One way of accounting for cancellations that occur later in the analyzed text is simply to extend the boundaries within which pragmatic inferences are evaluated _comma_ i.e. _comma_ to look ahead a few utterances .
3916,3,for each  and each _comma_ [ if is defined then is defined _comma_ and
3917,5,Dual-coding theory explains the coexistence of independent and interdependent phenomena with separate but connected structures .
3918,5,For _comma_ the size of the domain of nonterminals and associated stacks ( the analogue of the nonterminals in cfg ) is not bound by the grammar .
3919,3,113_comma_583 ( 93.1 % ) could be correctly mapped into their corresponding lemma form .
3920,3,This paper concentrates on paradigmatic similarity _comma_ because a paradigmatic relation can be established both inside a sentence and across sentence boundaries _comma_ while syntagmatic relations can be seen mainly inside a sentence -- like syntax deals with sentence structure .
3921,4,From the production of a question by Agent B _comma_ Agent A recognizes Agent B 's goal to find out the answer _comma_ and she adopts a goal to tell B the answer in order to be co-operative .
3922,3,Under both circumstances _comma_ a communication norm motivates the writer to first present the part leading to  ( in the second case this subgoal has already been achieved ) _comma_ and then to proceed with the two cases .
3923,3,On the contrary _comma_ in category  _comma_ there is not necessarily an explicit affected person .
3924,3,Because all the three nouns are adequately concatenated by ` read ' _comma_ a sentential representation is made in the subworld of  .
3925,3,This raises an interesting question .
3926,2,Although the learning process in these and some other systems is fully unsupervised and the accuracy of obtained rules reaches current state-of-the-art _comma_ they require specially prepared training data -- a pre-tagged training corpus _comma_ training examples _comma_ etc .
3927,3,The agent does not have to adopt the goal of answering the question as one of her personal goals in order to explain the behavior .
3928,3,Event referential forms such as do it _comma_ do that _comma_ and do so constitute full verb phrases in the syntax .
3929,5,Questions can mention concepts such as places _comma_ times _comma_ dates _comma_ fares _comma_ meals _comma_ airlines _comma_ plane types and ground transportation _comma_ but most utterances mention several of these _comma_ and there are few obvious restrictions on which of them can occur in the same utterance .
3930,3,We compare ADs to TODs with respect to how often control is exchanged by calculating the average number of turns between control shifts .
3931,3,M abstracts u under I iff [ M is a morph  _comma_
3932,3,Different network architectures have been investigated _comma_ but they all share the same input and output representation .
3933,4,Most language processing labeled as statistical involves associating real-number valued parameters to configurations of symbols .
3934,3,Finally _comma_ we implemented a Japanese language understanding system based on the theory we state in this paper _comma_ but due to the space limitation we will report the detail of implementation in other place in the near future .
3935,2,Class construction is then combinatorially very demanding and depends on frequency counts for joint events involving particular words _comma_ a potentially unreliable source of information as we noted above .
3936,3,Consider the following trees _comma_ where the np  s node is empty .
3937,3,We use a simple forward chaining technique to introduce obligations .
3938,5,The WARRANT in  can be used by the hearer in deliberating whether to ACCEPT or REJECT the speaker 's PROPOSAL in .
3939,3,Productions now specify how the tree associated with the mother is related to the trees associated with the daughters .
3940,3,As shown in Figure  _comma_ cat is declared to be a primitive type _comma_ and np _comma_ s _comma_ conj _comma_ noun are the categories used in this implementation .
3941,3,This robust parser can easily be scaled up and applied to various domains because this parser depends only on syntactic factors .
3942,3,To investigate issues involved in shallow processing and cooperative error handling _comma_ the PET ( processing errors in text ) system is being built .
3943,3,We have also briefly outlined the sense in which partial linearity gives rise to `` context-freeness '' in derivations and sketched how this can be exploited in order to obtain a tractable recognition algorithm .
3944,4,So why does Ray ( r ) in  REPEAT Harry 's ( h ) assertion of it does _comma_ and why does Harry PARAPHRASE himself and Ray in .
3945,1,In this paper _comma_ we only consider events and states _comma_ together termed eventualities in Bach 1981 .
3946,2,This means that the Xerox guesser creates more ambiguity for the disambiguator _comma_ assigning five instead of three POS s in the example above .
3947,3,The basic idea -- it 's the key idea underlying first order Kripke semantics -- is to move from dealing with a single model to dealing with a collection of models linked by an accessibility relation .
3948,3,assign thesaurus categories to both two kanzi character word ( section  )
3949,3,In our theory _comma_ this affected person plays a key role for semantics of complex sentence .
3950,3,As the subject of the copula that is countable it 's complement is judged to be denumerated by the proposed method .
3951,3,A meta-level  - abstraction is written .
3952,4,Here defaults allow for a standalone handling of the problem .
3953,3,The step forward taken in the work here is to show that there are three patterns of re-estimation behaviour _comma_ with differing guidelines for how to use BW effectively _comma_ and that to obtain a good starting point when a hand-tagged corpus is not available or is too small _comma_ either the lexicon or the transitions must be biased .
3954,4,As an example _comma_ we will take the sentence :
3955,3,We thus avoid relying on high-level inferences and very specific world knowledge postulates _comma_ our goal being to determine the temporal structure as much as possible prior to the application of higher-level inferences .
3956,3,It is clear that changing from one view of downstep to the other amounts to adding and deleting  and while leaving the tones themselves unchanged .
3957,3,This adds an additional assumption :
3958,3,If F is a feature structure _comma_ and F ' is a partial feature structure which differs from it only in that a single non-maximal node  of type in F has been refined to type expanded to in F ' _comma_ then .
3959,3,In case of a difference _comma_ the modified parts are sent to all concerned objects .
3960,3,It is important to notice that the types of disambiguation carried out by the tagger for German are significantly different from the disambiguation work for English and French .
3961,3,The following R-relations result from the f-structural relationships :
3962,3,The manuals are written using the PACE ( Perkins Approved Clear English ) guidelines _comma_ with the aim of producing clear _comma_ unambiguous texts .
3963,3,The ideal data would be records of peoples ' keystrokes when interacting with an editor while creating or editing a piece of text .
3964,3,Viewing the LFG ontology in such terms does no violence to intuition : indeed _comma_ as we shall see _comma_ a more direct mathematical embodiment of the LFG universe can hardly be imagined .
3965,3,We explicitly state the semantics of complex sentence as the relations among semantic roles .
3966,3,These phrase constraints could then be incorporated into the distributional tagger to characterize non-local dependencies .
3967,5,Re-estimation on any of the words in a class therefore counts towards re-estimation for all of them .
3968,3,Models do not in any sense `` code '' the LFG ontology : they take it pretty much at face value .
3969,3,Assume that there is a parser that constructs partial tree structures _comma_ as recognizing each word from the head sequentially .
3970,3,Assoc _comma_ the value of the association score .
3971,3,In a conversational setting _comma_ an accepted offer or a promise will incur an obligation .
3972,3,Both the software and the produced guessing rule-sets are available by contacting the author .
3973,2,Nevertheless _comma_ they do not in sufficient depth answer the question of how to guide the processes of default handling and repair within a generator .
3974,3,It also reduces the arbitrariness introduced into the clustering process by the order in which the training sentences are presented .
3975,3,Our method based on MDL resolves this issue in a unified fashion .
3976,3,Although this error rate is an appropriate measure for the performance of an HMM given a particular reference text _comma_ it says little about the amount of disambiguation done by the tagger _comma_ and nothing about the ambiguity types that were involved in the disambiguation process .
3977,4,The intentional story account of this goes as follows .
3978,3,Part of this discrepancy is due to the fact that we require a smaller number of new nonterminal symbols to achieve equivalent performance _comma_ but we have also found that our post-pass converges more quickly even given the same number of nonterminal symbols .
3979,3,A question establishes an obligation to answer the question .
3980,3,The following production may be glossed : `` if in state q and scanning the symbol X _comma_ then change state to q ' _comma_ write the symbol Y and move left '' .
3981,5,where  represents the discounted estimate for seen bigrams _comma_ the model for probability redistribution among the unseen bigrams _comma_ and is a normalization factor .
3982,7,In previous sections _comma_ we have classified several elliptical and event referential forms as to whether they leave behind an empty constituent in the syntax and whether they are anaphoric in the semantics .
3983,3,A module which replaces lambda abstracted variables with existential quantifiers in situ .
3984,3,By repeatedly using the postponement _comma_ elaboration _comma_ and suggestion moves _comma_ the two agents collaborate through discourse on refashioning the referring expression until they mutually believe that the recipient is confident that it is adequate .
3985,3,First _comma_ we define what constitutes an acceptable LHIP grammar _comma_ second _comma_ we describe the process of converting such a grammar into Prolog code _comma_ and third _comma_ we describe the analysis of input with such a grammar .
3986,3,The Parallel relation would specify no ordering ( see the potential context for passage  given in Section ) .
3987,3,Multi-layer networks _comma_ which can process linearly inseparable data _comma_ were also investigated _comma_ but are not necessary for this particular processing task .
3988,5,Resnik 1992 developed a method for automatically extracting class-based SRs from on-line corpora .
3989,5,Different concepts have been used in the literature as primitives .
3990,5,Katz uses the Good -Turing formula to replace the actual frequency of a bigram ( or an event _comma_ in general ) with a discounted frequency _comma_ _comma_ defined by
3991,5,But in Moortgat 's mixed system all the different resource management modes of the different systems are left intact in the combination and can be exploited in different parts of the grammar .
3992,3,Both discourse participants believe that the expert has knowledge about the domain _comma_ but only has partial information about the situation .
3993,5,For this system _comma_ the main goals are that an executable plan which meets the user 's goals is constructed and agreed upon by both the system and the user and then that the plan is executed .
3994,6,The anaphora module pertains to the recent methods _comma_ uses a set of resolution rules based on the focusing approach Sidner 1983 .
3995,5,However _comma_ if we assume that structures of that kind do not occur _comma_ a depth-first interpreter will be sufficient _comma_ e.g. the inference rules of the algorithm can be encoded and interpreted directly in Prolog .
3996,3,All inferences depend on the evidence to support them _comma_ and stronger evidence can defeat weaker evidence .
3997,3,All data were analysed statistically by  and all differences cited are significant at the 0.05 level .
3998,5,Moreover _comma_ as noted by Zeevat 1990 _comma_ the use of any kind of ordered threading will tend to fail for Bach-Peters sentences _comma_ such as :
3999,3,The macroplanner of PROVERB elaborates on communicative goals _comma_ selects and orders pieces of information to fulfill these goals .

4004,3,When no top-down presentation operator applies _comma_ PROVERB chooses a bottom-up operator .
4005,5,It has been suggested that generation of self repairs is useful in cases where there are severe time constraints _comma_ or where there is rapidly changing background information Carletta p.c. .
4006,3,However it is difficult to exclude these using syntactic constraints _comma_ without also excluding the more acceptable :
4007,3,The output function  sums up three activity values in appropriate proportion and limits the output value to [ 0_comma_1 ] .
4008,3,Note that there is no garden path effect even if the preposition is separated from the disambiguating head noun by a series of adjectives : ( `` I saw the man with the neat _comma_ quaint _comma_ old-fashioned moustache / telescope '' ) .
4009,3,(B2) AMBIGUITY :
4010,3,Our model is capable of selecting the most effective aspect to address in its pursuit of conflict resolution in cases where multiple conflicts arise _comma_ and of selecting appropriate evidence to justify the need for such modification .

4014,3,Therefore inflections are as follows : gar-re _comma_ gar-i _comma_ etc .
4015,3,Note that this condition rules out the production responsible for building full binary trees since the x _comma_ y _comma_ x ' and y ' subtrees are not siblings in the mother 's tree despite the fact that all of the daughters share a common subtree z.

4027,7,To understand how these techniques are applied in the case of PLPATR _comma_ it is therefore helpful to consider first the somewhat simpler case of LIG .
4028,3,( inducing a Parallel relation instead of Narration ) _comma_ a temporal ordering among the sentences is no longer implied .
4029,4,identifying genres _comma_ and
4030,5,Mann and Thompson proposed a linguistic structure of text describing relationships between sentences and their relative importance Mann and Thompson 1987 .
4031,2,Unlike other approaches we don't require the corpus to be pre-annotated but use it in its raw form .
4032,3,We present the quantitative results of hand-simulating these algorithms _comma_ but this analysis naturally gives rise to both a qualitative evaluation and recommendations for performing such evaluations in general .
4033,4,Passages  are instead understood as the second clause explaining the first _comma_ indicating that the reverse temporal ordering holds .
4034,1,We will show elsewhere that the theoretical analysis outlined here applies to that more general problem _comma_ but for now we will only address the more specific problem in which the objects are nouns and the contexts are verbs that take the nouns as direct objects .
4035,3,The decomposition of expand-plan calls the plan constructor with the goal of constructing a modifiers schema and with the suggested attribute as input -- in a sense _comma_ continuing the construction of the initial referring plan .
4036,5,It provides the pragmatics processor with representations which include of a set of reference markers .
4037,4,Furthermore _comma_ the truth of  cannot be in question _comma_ for instead of _comma_ Harry could not say Yup _comma_ but that doesn't knock her out .
4038,5,In the 1970 s and early 1980 s several computational implementations motivated the use of incremental interpretation as a way of dealing with structural and lexical ambiguity ( a survey is given in Haddock 1989 ) .
4039,3,Writing something like  _comma_ where W may contain occurrences of B _comma_ says that W holds for the contextually unique individual B which satisfies the restriction that B is a woman ( is a singleton set of women ) .

4044,4,If we take the construction heavy smoker in English and attempt to translate it into French and German _comma_ we find that a literal translation of heavy yields the wrong result _comma_ since the concept expressed by the adjective ( something like ` excessive ' ) is translated by grand ( large ) in French and stark ( strong ) in German .
4045,3,The results are summarized in Table  .
4046,3,If sentence two appeared alone in the abstract without sentence one _comma_ it would be difficult to understand the text .

4050,3,Forms that include clitics are analysed as a sequence of items separated by the symbols  or depending on whether the clitics precede or follow the head word .
4051,3,As in that work _comma_ a discrimination net of root forms would be required ; however _comma_ this could be augmented independently of spelling pattern creation _comma_ so that the flexibility resulting from not composing the lexicon with the spelling rules would not be lost .
4052,5,The rule probabilities specify the cost of making particular choices about the way in which the rules develop .
4053,3,In English _comma_ however _comma_ since most of letter mutations occur in the last letter of the main word it is possible to account for it .
4054,2,While many aspects of CCG semantics can be reasonably simulated in first-order unification _comma_ the simulation breaks down on some of the most interesting cases that CCG can theoretically handle .
4055,3,I believe this contrast has been exaggerated though historically it has had some validity in terms of accepted practice .
4056,4,We pay our attention to the general structure of Japanese utterance which is helpful to represent semantics of complex sentence .
4057,3,Hence _comma_ Mark saw them would receive a valid analysis _comma_ as would Mary and Mark saw them _comma_ provided that the grammar contains a rule for conjoined NPs ; John saw them _comma_ on the other hand _comma_ would not .
4058,3,The observations we can make about these results are as follows .
4059,3,The perfect is analyzed by using the notion of a nucleus Moens and Steedman 1988 to account for the inner structure of an eventuality .
4060,4,Therefore _comma_ any use of a feature structure to describe an object demands that the feature structure can be interpreted as true or false of the object .
4061,3,Efficient storage of stacks can therefore be achieved by storing in P [ i _comma_ j ] just that bounded amount of information ( nonterminal plus top of stack ) relevant to rule application _comma_ together with a pointer to any entry in  representing a subderivation from an object .
4062,3,Verbs are classified according to their measure ( M ) : there are 15 trilateral measures and 4 quadrilateral ones .
4063,5,Finally _comma_ it is important to briefly consider upstep _comma_ since it has been used in some analyses of Bamileke Dschang ( e.g. Stewart 's ) .
4064,4,It is less widely accepted that there is a need for incremental interpretation in computational applications .
4065,5,Note that off-line parsability is one possible way of ensuring that this is the case .
4066,3,a set of initial symbol biases _comma_
4067,3,To see this _comma_ note that an instantaneous description of a Turing Machine can be encoded with a tree as shown in Figure  .
4068,3,The formalism should be easy to use with probabilistic processing techniques _comma_ ideally having a close correspondence to a simple probabilistic model such as a Markov process .

4077,3,We run marked up training data through an early version of the network trained on the same data _comma_ so the results should be almost all correct .
4078,3,Rare syntactic constructions pose a related problem : There are not enough instances to justify the creation of a separate cluster .
4079,3,Nevertheless _comma_ they must be mutually disjoint _comma_ i.e. not related by hyperonymy .
4080,3,Sometimes the choice of the English translation of a modifier will depend on the countability of the noun phrase .
4081,6,By extending the analysis of temporal subordinate clauses in Kamp and Reyle 1993 _comma_ to sentences which include quantification over eventualities _comma_ we can propose an alternative DRT solution to Partee 's quantification problem .

4087,3,The search for the lowering site is of particular importance .
4088,3,It is then possible to specify operations which act as purely applicative operations with respect to the left and right arguments lists _comma_ but more like composition with respect to the wh-list .
4089,6,Best-first search by means of an agenda .
4090,3,According to the model of achieving mutual understanding that was outlined in section  _comma_ utterance provides linguistic evidence that Harry ( h ) believes that the proposition realized by utterance licenses the inference of in this context .
4091,5,The Direct Inversion Approach ( DIA ) of Minnen et al. 1995 overcomes these problems by making the reordering process more goal-directed and developing a reformulation technique that allows the successful treatment of rules which exhibit head-recursion .
4092,3,This goal is analogous to that used in the work described earlier on finding word classes by clustering .
4093,3,A sufficient condition for them to be the same is that  and that .
4094,3,The two types of inference are distinguished by the level in the syntax from which these arguments are retrieved .
4095,3,Since 1 is a unit element of F _comma_  .
4096,6,A word-by-word incremental parser for a lexicalised version of dependency grammar Milward 1992 .
4097,3,Figure  illustrates how directly the CCG operations can be encoded .
4098,3,However _comma_ unlike gapping _comma_ VP-ellipsis also results in an independently anaphoric form in the semantics .
4099,3,The technique achieves a good coverage _comma_ even with few co-occurrence triples .
4100,3,If a principled way could be found to identify false positives _comma_ their effect should be reported as well as part of any quantitative evaluation .
4101,5,A lexical entry qualifies as a potential leaf node if its semantic form is a non-trivial substructure of the input semantics ( rule ( lex ) ) .

4103,3,The choice between the two is forced by the presence or absence of a focussed item .
4104,4,Knowing the dialect areas helps one allocate resources in language research and has implications for language learners _comma_ publishers _comma_ broadcasters _comma_ educators _comma_ and language planners .
4105,5,The common point of view restricts the input to be sufficient for generation ( see _comma_ e.g. _comma_ the Text Structure by Meteer 1990 for a syntactic generator ) .
4106,5,Park 1992 proposes a solution within first-order unification that can handle not only sentence _comma_ but also more complex examples with determiners .
4107,7,how default handling is integrated into a system ( see section  ) _comma_
4108,3,We would like to extend our method to use this information in the future .
4109,3,In other words _comma_ the set of all strings labelling root to frontier paths of derivation trees is a context-free language .
4110,3,Meaning of a text lies in the texture of paradigmatic and syntagmatic relations between words Hjelmslev 1943 .
4111,3,Also _comma_ the predicate atomic-type is declared to be true for the four atomic categories .
4112,3,If not _comma_ he will believe that there is an error at the constraint that checks his confidence threshold .
4113,3,Note that in Figure  the daughter nodes labelled B and D share a common subtree and the subtrees shared between the mother and the B and D daughters appear as siblings in the tree associated with the mother .
4114,2,Also _comma_ it allows some flexibility in cases where pragmatics strongly suggests that quantifiers are copied and distributed for multiple extensional verbs ; unlike the Partee and Rooth account _comma_ this would apply equally to the case where there are also intensional verbs and the case where there are not .
4115,5,The network shown in Fig.  is for a very small portion of the reference network for the Collins English Dictionary ( 1979 edition ) in the CD-ROM I Liberman 1991 _comma_ with 60K head words + 1.6M definition words .
4116,3,The process consists of the following 2 stages .
4117,3,A three-digit number stands for a thesaurus category .
4118,3,When  assumes a word or a special symbol ` 0 ' as its value _comma_ we refer to the corresponding model as a ` word-based model ' .
4119,3,As noted above _comma_ the precise grammaticality predictions depend on the kind of parsing model which is encoded in the states .
4120,4,Infants face the difficult problem of segmenting continuous speech into words without the benefit of a fully developed lexicon .
4121,3,This is a hybrid system .
4122,6,While the overall planning mechanism follows the RST-based planning approach Moore 1989 _comma_ Reithinger 1991 _comma_ the planning operators more closely resemble the schemata in schema-based planning McKeown 1985 _comma_ Paris 1988 .
4123,3,For example _comma_ kazukazu-no and takusan-no can all be translated as `` many '' .
4124,2,However _comma_ Fisher and Tokura in press found no evidence that prosody can accurately predict word boundaries _comma_ so the task of finding words remains .
4125,3,is a diagonal k-by-k matrix that contains the singular values of C in descending order .
4126,7,The following section describes the implementation of this new model .
4127,7,how assumptions are cancelled when they turn out to be inconsistent with newly arriving input ( see section  ) .
4128,3,Descriptions of French _comma_ Polish and English inflectional morphology have been developed for it _comma_ and I show how various aspects of the mechanism allow phenomena in these languages to be handled .
4129,3,Secondly _comma_ we selected test corpora with varying degrees of similarity to the training corpus : the same text _comma_ text from a similar domain _comma_ and text which is significantly different .
4130,5,The second formulation of the normalization is computationally preferable because the total number of possible bigram types far exceeds the number of observed types .
4131,3,When parses are postulated for a sentence negative as well as positive examples are likely to occur .
4132,3,directional prepositions can be :
4133,3,Since schemata-based planning covers only proofs of some particular structure _comma_ it is complemented by a mechanism called bottom-up presentation .
4134,3,For instance _comma_ precedence monotonicity requires that the status of a clause ( strictly _comma_ its lexical head ) as main or subordinate has to be transferred into German .
4135,3,That is _comma_ they provide many linguistic clues and the system can extract the rhetorical structure exactly .
4136,3,Bottom-up deduction is preferable to top-down deduction because it allows incremental processing ( even for head-driven grammars ) _comma_ it is data-driven _comma_ no subsumption check is needed _comma_ and preference values attached to lexical items can be used to guide best-first search .
4137,3,The next question is how to represent the semantics of complex sentence in feature structure ( called FS henceforth ) .
4138,3,This level of classification can be done automatically in future .
4139,3,In the following example _comma_ the chart is inspected to reveal what constituents have been built during a failed parse of the truncated sentence
4140,3,We also found that control was distributed and exchanged differently in the ADs and TODs .
4141,5,And my own treatment of selectional constraints Resnik 1993 provides a way to describe the plausibility of co-occurrence in terms of WordNet 's semantic categories _comma_ using co-occurrence relationships mediated by syntactic structure .
4142,3,In the first domain _comma_ we created this grammar by hand ; the grammar was a small English-like probabilistic context-free grammar consisting of roughly 10 nonterminal symbols _comma_ 20 terminal symbols _comma_ and 30 rules .
4143,2,In contrast with most other approaches _comma_ we provide a consistent methodology for computing these inferences and for determining whether they are cancelled or not for all possible configurations : simple and complex utterances and sequences of utterances .
4144,5,Traverse all branches below node X to the left of path p in a left-to-right breadth-first fashion .
4145,3,There are two important questions which arise at the rule acquisition stage - how to choose the scoring threshold  and what is the performance of the rule-sets produced with different thresholds .
4146,3,Now _comma_ a partial parse can support such a process .
4147,5,Other research directed towards improving the throughput of unification-based parsing systems has been concerned with the unification operation itself _comma_ which can consume up to 90 % of parse time Tomabechi 1991 in systems using lexicalist grammar formalisms ( e.g. HPSG ) Pollard and Sag 1987 .
4148,3,If the similarity-based estimate is relatively high _comma_ a bigram would receive a higher estimate than predicted by the uniform discounting method .
4149,2,Evaluation of tagging accuracy on unknown words using texts unseen by the guessers and the taggers at the training phase showed that tagging with the automatically induced cascading guesser was consistently more accurate than previously quoted results known to the author ( 85 % ) .
4150,4,B always deliberates every proposal and B probably knows of options which compete with proposal P. Then B cannot decide whether to accept P without a warrant .
4151,2,In the first place _comma_ Cutting et al. do not compare the success rate in their work with that achieved from a hand-tagged training text with no re-estimation .
4152,3,This leads to the interpretation of a bound variable as a `` scoped constant '' - it acts like a constant that is not visible from the top of the term _comma_ but which becomes visible during the descent through the abstraction .
4153,3,Suppose that _comma_ in addition to the tree shown in Figure  the grammar generates the pair of trees shown in Figure .
4154,5,A new grammar is created by cutting up each implicit parse tree in the treebank at appropriate points _comma_ creating a set of new rules that consist of chunks of original grammar rules .
4155,3,Moreover _comma_ there is a practical issue to be addressed : how should we go about saying which models we deem ` good ' ?
4156,4,For example _comma_ consider  :
4157,3,Thus _comma_ the coarseness or fineness of clustering also determines the degree of smoothing .
4158,4,Lexicography is also interested in the acquisition of SRs ( both defining in context approach and lexical semantics work Levin 1992 ) .
4159,5,In incremental generation _comma_ most authors agree on the necessity of using defaults De Smedt 1990 _comma_ Kitano 1990 _comma_ Ward 1991 .
4160,5,Class-based and similarity-based models provide an alternative to the independence assumption .
4161,3,We provide a special rule for duplicating quantified NPs when necessary :
4162,3,Certain parameters probably vary more in certain text types than others _comma_ and they may have a skewed distribution as well .
4163,3,I write  for the path interpretation function under I .
4164,4,For example _comma_ Arabic /kuttib/ ` caused to write - perfect passive ' is composed from the root morpheme { ktb } ` notion of writing ' and the vowel melody morpheme { ui } ` perfect passive ' ; the two are arranged according to the pattern morpheme { CVCCVC } ` causative ' .
4165,5,Statistical NLP methods determine the likelihood of a word combination according to its frequency in a training corpus .
4166,3,The correct temporal relations are shown in  .
4167,3,Although performance of the technique presented is pretty good _comma_ some of the detected problems could possibly be solved .
4168,5,the input state for evaluation of John will buy it right away is the output state from the antecedent a car impresses him .
4169,4,Each participant will _comma_ on occasion _comma_ take the conversational lead .
4170,5,Although individual examples might be possible to rule out using appropriate features _comma_ it is difficult to see how to do this in general whilst retaining a calculus suitable for incremental interpretation .
4171,3,This could be achieved by running the parser over corpora to provide probabilities of particular transitions given particular words .
4172,3,The rationale for this is that we wish to cut up the parse trees where we can expect a lot of variation i.e. where it is difficult to predict which rule will be resolved on next .
4173,6,We extend the general algorithm for least-errors recognition to adopt it as the recovery mechanism in our robust parser .
4174,2,Unfortunately _comma_ there are few corpora annotated with word sense information _comma_ and computing reliable statistics on word senses rather than words will require more data _comma_ rather than less .
4175,4,Theory on its own does not help much in deciding which point of view should dominate .
4176,5,It then puts a link between a node pair with the largest mutual information value I _comma_ provided that I exceeds a certain threshold which depends on the node pair and adding that link will not create a loop in the current dependency graph .
4177,5,Note that if the structure corresponded to Craige 's mom likes her then the NP for Craige would be an NP to the left of p that has an NP node between it and X _comma_ and Craige would be selected as the antecedent for her .
4178,3,For example _comma_ in  the preference technique which allows us to choose the first thread over the second is one which assigns a higher rating to a thread whose tense is parallel to that of the new sentence ; in this case both Sam rang the bell and Hannah opened the door are in the simple past tense .
4179,5,To date _comma_ grammar checkers and other programs which deal with illformed input usually step directly from spelling considerations to a full-scale sentence parse .
4180,4,Where else do we see a phenomenon of this kind ?
4181,3,The parser then selects the parse ranked best ( i.e. the parse of lowest overall score ) .
4182,3,When it is simple present _comma_ the location time coincides with the utterance time .
4183,3,The first pass row refers to the main grammar induction phase of our algorithm _comma_ and the post-pass row refers to the Inside-Outside post-pass .
4184,3,The justifications `` Du '' _comma_ `` Dsubgr '' _comma_ `` Ds '' _comma_ `` Dg '' _comma_ and `` Tsol '' stand for the definitions of unit element _comma_ of subgroup _comma_ of subset _comma_ of group _comma_ and the theorem about solution _comma_ respectively .
4185,3,We take the referring expression plan itself to be the identification plan .
4186,7,The model 's error types are analysed in section  _comma_ and conclusions are drawn in section .
4187,3,In this class of grammars every rule has the form A  a B ( A _comma_ B { non-terminals } _comma_ a { terminals } ) and all trees have the simple structure :
4188,1,Why should computers interpret language incrementally ?
4189,3,For the first processing stage we need to place the subject markers _comma_ and _comma_ as a further task _comma_ disambiguate tags .
4190,3,The operation of this principle helps conversants avoid replanning resulting from inconsistency in beliefs _comma_ and thus provides a way to manage the augmentation of the common ground efficiently .
4191,2,While many of the intuitions underlying these approaches seems close to right _comma_ we claim it is a mistake to attempt to analyze this behavior as arising entirely from the agent 's high-level goals .
4192,3,The number of dialogues was small and taken from a single problem domain .
4193,3,The process of determining a noun phrase 's countability and number is shown in Figure  .
4194,3,The use of the past perfect ( as in passage  ) ) is one such cue since it implies reversed temporal ordering ; the use of an explicit conjunction indicating a coherence relation other than Narration ( as in passages is another such cue .
4195,3,But then the resulting temporal structures will be highly ambiguous even in small discourses .
4196,2,It cannot therefore be used in a complete probabilistic framework _comma_ such as n-gram language models or probabilistic lexicalized grammars Schabes 1992 _comma_ Lafferty et al. 1992 .
4197,3,The tests were conducted in a similar manner to those of the first experiment _comma_ by building a lexicon and transitions from a hand tagged training corpus _comma_ and then applying them to a test corpus with varying degrees of degradation .
4198,3,Specifically _comma_ the classes considered to be correct sometimes aren't ranked in the higher positions of the Assoc ( e.g. _comma_ Table  ) .
4199,4,In the case of Ireland _comma_ everyone agrees that Gaelic is nowadays found in three main dialects : that of Ulster _comma_ that of Connacht _comma_ and that of Munster Siadhail 1989 .
4200,3,Let t _comma_ t ' be finite ( possibly null ) sequences of the modalities  and _comma_ and let f _comma_ f ' be finite ( possibly null ) sequences of feature modalities .
4201,1,In this paper _comma_ we propose a new method for automatic construction of thesauri .
4202,3,Salience _comma_ for our purposes in direction-giving _comma_ is primarily visual prominence _comma_ but can also involve identifiability _comma_ familiarity _comma_ and functional importance Devlin 1976 _comma_ Lynch 1960 .
4203,5,Several methods have been proposed to deal with anaphora resolution and prepositional phrase ( PP ) attachment phenomenon and separately _comma_ so that the literature is very abundant : for PPs see e.g. _comma_ Frazier and Fodor 1979 _comma_ Hobbs 1990 _comma_ Wilks and Huang 1985 ) _comma_ and for anaphora see e.g. _comma_ Carter 1986 _comma_ Reinhart 1983 _comma_ Sidner 1983 .
4204,5,In our simulated annealing algorithm _comma_ we could alternatively employ the Maximum Likelihood Estimator ( MLE ) as criterion for the best probabilistic model _comma_ instead of MDL .
4205,5,Each word is ( perhaps ambiguously ) assigned a category and LF _comma_ and when the syntactical operations assign a new category to a constituent _comma_ the corresponding semantic operations produce a new LF for that constituent as well .
4206,5,On this view _comma_ a key element of local coherence is centering _comma_ a system of rules and constraints that govern the relationship between what the discourse is about and some of the linguistic choices made by the discourse participants _comma_ e.g. choice of grammatical function _comma_ syntactic structure _comma_ and type of referring expression ( proper noun _comma_ definite or indefinite description _comma_ reflexive or personal pronoun _comma_ etc . )
4207,3,Excessive use of self-corrections or erroneous expressions should beavoided because they decrease intelligibility of the utterance .
4208,5,The parameter  is trained through the Inside-Outside algorithm on held-out data .
4209,3,All of these effects fall out naturally as a corollary of the imperative of ` best possible estimation _comma_ ' the original motivation behind the MDL principle .
4210,3,We concentrate throughout on what information about language and translation is coded and how it is expressed as logical constraints or statistical parameters .
4211,3,This result is in accordance with the informal reasoning given in section  .
4212,5,However _comma_ on the subsequent input of hurts _comma_ the structure can be reanalysed by asserting an extra clausal node ( call it S  ) dominating NP ( which will then become the embedded subject ) _comma_ but which is in turn dominated by the matrix VP .
4213,4,the lexicon ;
4214,3,More detailed investigation of language representation issues will be undertaken .
4215,3,We define  as the set of at most k nearest words to ( excluding itself ) _comma_ that also satisfy .
4216,3,This work is based on the following premises :
4217,3,Assembled data includes the Birkbeck corpus Mitton 1986 and multifarious misspelling lists ( without context ) .
4218,4,Although such pairs of trees are reminiscent of synchronous trees in TAG 's Shieber and Schabes 1991 _comma_ they are simpler in various ways _comma_ in particular because we will not make use of the adjunction operation later on .
4219,3,Just because an action is obligatory with respect to a set of rules R does not mean that the agent will perform the action .
4220,3,Then the abstracts were generated and were compared with the selected key sentences .
4221,3,Consider again the earlier problematic example  of coordination .
4222,7,In this section we want to generalize the ideas described above for CFG to DCG .
4223,5,Entropy is well-known from physics _comma_ but the concept of perplexity is perhaps better known in the speech-recognition and natural-language communities .
4224,3,We now analyze the examples presented in Section  _comma_ repeated below _comma_ using this approach :
4225,3,This makes the improvements against the base-line Xerox guesser 28 % in precision and 7 % in coverage .
4226,3,The experimental result shows 68 % - 77 % accuracy in error recovery .
4227,1,In general _comma_ we are interested on how to organize a set of linguistic objects such as words according to the contexts in which they occur _comma_ for instance grammatical constructions or n-grams .
4228,1,whether the form is anaphoric in the semantics .
4229,3,There are always exactly n - 1 non-leaf nodes _comma_ so the complexity of the test phase is O(n) .
4230,3,where  has again been extracted to save space .
4231,3,A simplifying assumption that is often made to deal with this difficulty is that random variables ( case slots ) are mutually independent .
4232,2,Notice that our algorithm produces a significantly more compact model than the n-gram model _comma_ while running significantly faster than the Inside-Outside algorithm even though we use an Inside-Outside post-pass .
4233,5,There are several distinct types of transitions from one utterance to the next .
4234,5,According to de Swart 1991 _comma_ the subordinate clause determines the reference time of the verb _comma_ which lies anteriorly to the event time .
4235,3,The following excerpt demonstrates this structure .
4236,3,Some examples of translations before and after the introduction of the new processing are given below .
4237,3,In this approach _comma_ each of the relevant temporal markers resides in its appropriate box _comma_ yielding the correct quantificational structure .
4238,3,Therefore _comma_ the case value can be inherited .
4239,4,In compilation _comma_ one may compose any or all of
4240,5,In order to obtain completeness in the general case _comma_ the inference schemata of the head-corner generator must be executed by a breadth-first interpreter _comma_ since a depth-first interpreter will loop if the semantic analysis rules admit that subtrees are associated with semantic forms which are not proper substructures of the input semantics _comma_ and if these subtrees can be composed recursively .
4241,3,This suggests that conditioning the occurrence of a grammar rule on the identity of its mother ( as in the 2-rule case ) accounts for some _comma_ but not all _comma_ of the contextual influences that operate .
4242,3,An obvious case is that of trigrams _comma_ for which the sparse data problem is much more severe .
4243,3,All four of these trees are constrained to be equal by the production given above _comma_ which requires that they have identical left ( i.e. z ) subtrees ( these subtrees must be the full binary tree  ) .
4244,1,In this paper _comma_ I demonstrate the computational benefits of marrying a tractable syntax and an explicit semantics by creating a simple and effective algorithm to decide the satisfiability of a feature structure .
4245,3,Figure  also fails to indicate whether the two algorithms missed the same examples or are covering a different set of phenomena _comma_ i.e. what the relative distribution of the successes and failures are .
4246,3,However _comma_ since the number of tags with better and worse performance is about the same ( 7 and 5 ) _comma_ one cannot conclude with certainty that generalized context vectors induce tags of higher quality .
4247,3,For example _comma_ it would be possible _comma_ by providing a suitable definition for set_dynamic_threshold / 2 _comma_ to set T to 0.5 when more than one optional adjective has been found _comma_ and 0.9 otherwise .
4248,3,In addition _comma_ garu has an allophonic root form gat and _comma_ gat-ta ( past-form ) _comma_ gat-teiru ( progressive-form ) and so on are derived from gat .
4249,3,Any serious NLP system will include some way of dealing with the interpretation of cases like  _comma_ and almost any such mechanism should be open to adaptation to deal with focus along the suggested lines .
4250,1,We propose in this paper an algorithm that deals with both phenomena _comma_ in the same analyser .
4251,3,where  .
4252,3,Parameters of the system will be varied _comma_ for example the breadth of the purview _comma_ the position of the purview focus _comma_ the number of correction candidates and the timing of their generation .
4253,2,Another focus of current research has been the modelling of speaker and listener goals Allen and Perrault 1980 _comma_ Cohen and Levesque 1985 but there has been little research on real dialogues investigating how goals are communicated and inferred .
4254,5,The part of the HPSG system that uses the centering algorithm for pronoun binding is called the pragmatics processor .
4255,3,To our knowledge the question _comma_ whether the Lambek calculus itself or its associated parsing problem are NP-hard _comma_ are still open .
4256,4,This provides an elegant account in the simple case _comma_ but requires a strong assumption of co-operativeness .
4257,2,First _comma_ the precise order in which quantifiers are scoped and ellipses resolved determines the final interpretation of elliptical sentences .
4258,3,When we enter some place or go out of some place _comma_ we have different spatial relation with the location ( ie . inside / outside ) before and after the motion .
4259,3,This local tree is licensed by the following production which respects all of the constraints on PLTG productions .
4260,4,Do the three provinces separate out so neatly for intrinsic linguistic reasons _comma_ or simply because their speakers have become so widely separated from each other geographically as speakers in intervening areas have adopted English ?
4261,3,These categories ' forms are ``  P-garu '' or its past form `` P-gat-ta '' _comma_ where P is a subjective adjective ( category 4 in Table ) or is a verb followed by ta-gar ( category 5 in Table ) _comma_ and is the experiencer of P which is possibly zero .
4262,2,However _comma_ there are composition rules for semantic representations which violate this restriction _comma_ e.g. the schemata for the construction of Underspecified Discourse Representation Structures ( UDRSs ) Frank and Reyle 1992 where _comma_ in general _comma_ the root of a tree is associated with a strictly larger semantic structure than any of the leaves .
4263,3,the ellipsis is contained within a form expression whose category is
4264,7,Subsection  presents a simple two-level grammar which describes the above data .
4265,3,These results provide support for the control rules .
4266,4,Semantic relation between words _comma_ which is the focus of this paper _comma_ is hard to recognize by computers .
4267,3,Repeat until no further movements are required .
4268,3,The behaviour of LHIP can best be understood in terms of the notions of island _comma_ span _comma_ cover and threshold :
4269,3,To allow the above-mentioned types of information to mutually constrain each other _comma_ we employ a hierarchy of rhetorical and temporal relations ( illustrated in Figure  ) _comma_ using the ALE system in such a way that clues such as tense and cue words work together to reduce the number of possible temporal structures .
4270,5,Distance measurement in a reference network depends on the definition of link length .
4271,3,These semantic properties can be characterized by a restructuration of the space induced by the so-called reference location ( lref ) Talmy 1983 .
4272,5,By the time the rabbit in has been processed _comma_ the only rabbits remaining in consideration are rabbits which are in something .
4273,7,Finally we will discuss the future of the model .
4274,5,Alternatively _comma_ if B deliberates whether to accept P _comma_ but B knows of no competing options _comma_ then P will be the best option whether or not A tells B the warrant for P .
4275,3,Our choice of constraints is motivated by showing how they generalize constraints inherent in Linear Indexed Grammar ( LIG ) .
4276,3,The threshold of a rule is the minimum value for the ratio of its coverage c to its span s which must hold in order for the rule to succeed .
4277,5,For a given grammar G and input string  the algorithm constructs an array P _comma_ having elements _comma_ where element stores all and only those nonterminals of G that derive the substring .
4278,2,These results _comma_ however _comma_ are not directly comparable to the implementations described in this paper _comma_ since the tag sets employed differ to some extent .
4279,3,In a second step _comma_ the method will be extended in order to handle the movement of ( syntactic ) heads in a logically well-defined manner .
4280,3,67 of the 90 good / close parses are labeled as `` good '' by the heuristic .
4281,3,Also _comma_ a command or request by the other party will bring about an obligation to perform the requested action .
4282,3,relates adjacent F values _comma_ but we would also like to relate non-adjacent values _comma_ given the sequence of intervening tones .
4283,5,This is reflected in the order-sensitive interleaving of scope and ellipsis resolution in Dalrymple et al. 's account .
4284,3,Since there are 22 words ( including punctuation ) the total number of strings would be
4285,5,On the other end of the scale of parameter production for HMM POS disambiguators is the extraction of parameters exclusively on the basis of ( larger ) pre-tagged text corpora _comma_ with no Baum-Welch re-estimation involved .
4286,3,The preferred reading for sentence  _comma_ in which only one quantifier scopes over the two extensional predicates _comma_ is shown below :
4287,3,This requires that the quantified NP meaning be duplicated _comma_ since otherwise no readings result .
4288,3,The following is based on what we noticed to be useful during the developing the taggers .
4289,5,Example  indeed shows that coherence relations need to be utilized to account for temporal relations _comma_ but it does not bear on the issue of whether the past perfect is anaphoric .
4290,3,The difficulty of disambiguation can be quantified by the ambiguity rate : the number of possible tag assignments divided by the number of words in a given text .
4291,3,But how can we ensure that re-estimation will produce a good quality model ?
4292,3,Processing is also similar _comma_ with the encountering of a conjunction causing back-up to an earlier stage in the parsing history .
4293,5,Thus conceptually at least _comma_ their processes are agglomerative : a large initial set of words is clumped into a smaller number of clusters .
4294,3,If this is the case _comma_ it sends an error message up to the uppermost object of the hierarchy that actually is engaged in uttering .
4295,4,A discourse strategy is a strategy for communicating with another agent .
4296,3,We give an informal argument for this .
4297,5,The best known such methods are genetic search Goldberg 1989 and annealing search van Laarhoven and Aarts 1987 .
4298,5,If they are well-formed _comma_ the system halts indicating success .
4299,1,We address this topic in describing a novel approach to HPSG Pollard and Sag 1994 based language processing that uses an off-line compiler to automatically prime a declarative grammar for generation or parsing _comma_ and hands the primed grammar to an advanced Earley processor .
4300,5,In Clark and Wilkes-Gibbs 's experiments _comma_ for example _comma_ it is one of the tangram figures .
4301,3,For case  _comma_ the spelling rules may be applied directly _comma_ just as in rule compilation _comma_ to a specified surface or lexical character sequence _comma_ as if no lexical or morphotactic constraints existed .
4302,2,The approach described here is quite different .
4303,3,The changes in the tagsets were motivated purely by grammatical considerations _comma_ and did not take the errors actually observed into account .
4304,6,This is a technique similar to the type of centering used for nominal anaphora Sidner 1983 _comma_ Grosz et al. 1983 .
4305,4,see Kaplan and Kay 1994 for an exposition of the mathematical basis .
4306,3,Incorporating this method into the machine translation system ALT-J / E helped to improve the percentage of noun phrases with correctly generated articles and number from 65 % to 73 % .
4307,3,Rather _comma_ what is of interest is that the improvement ( or otherwise ) in particular language models from the application of clustering is consistent with those observations .
4308,5,Crocker 1992 develops `` a ` representational ' reformulation of the transformational model which decomposes syntactic analysis into several representation types -- including phrase structure _comma_ chains _comma_ and coindexation -- allowing one to maintain the strictly local characterisation of principles with respect to their relevant representation types _comma_ '' Crocker and Lewin 1992 _comma_ p. 511 .
4309,3,Note that if State-Application is chosen _comma_ or the first of the State-Prediction possibilities _comma_ the fragment John likes Sue retains a flat structure .
4310,5,Each utterance will generally contain acts ( or partial acts ) at each of these levels .
4311,4,They might want to
4312,3,noun vs. verb ( affaire _comma_ bout _comma_ place ) _comma_
4313,3,enumerate possible segmentations of an input compound noun by consulting headwords of the thesaurus ( BGH )
4314,2,It relates to the inadequacy of the dominant theories in linguistics to capture ` shades ' of meaning or degrees of acceptability which are often recognized by people outside the field as important inherent properties of natural language .
4315,1,This paper has presented a computational strategy for engaging in collaborative negotiation to square away conflicts in agents ' beliefs .
4316,3,That is _comma_ the f-structure  appears at the end of the singleton path P in the f-structure .
4317,3,Intended testing is discussed .
4318,3,where  are the average and the standard deviation of the distances from the - th origin .
4319,3,We show that the Parsing Problem for SDL-grammars is NP-complete by a reduction of the 3-Partition Problem to it .
4320,4,Unfortunately _comma_ input information can be insufficient in two respects :
4321,3,While these may be useful heuristics from a practical point of view _comma_ the next step forward is to look for an automatic way of predicting the accuracy of the tagging process given a corpus and a model .
4322,4,Despite all the complexities that individualize the recognition stage for each of these inferences _comma_ all of them can be defeated by context _comma_ by knowledge _comma_ beliefs _comma_ or plans of the agents that constitute part of the context _comma_ or by other pragmatic rules .
4323,6,Finally _comma_ one might question whether infants have the ability we are trying to model -- that is _comma_ whether they can identify words embedded in sentences ; Jusczyk and Aslin submitted found that 7 1/2-month - olds can do so .
4324,3,For example _comma_ the f-structure given in  results in two R-relations :
4325,5,Also _comma_ because the recovery process runs when a normal parser terminates unsuccessfully _comma_ the performance of the normal parser does not decrease in case of handling grammatical sentences .
4326,3,For the French text the tag set described in Chanod and Tapanainen 1994 with 37 different tags is used .
4327,3,It is therefore necessary to make various generalisations over the states _comma_ for example by ignoring the R  lists .
4328,2,Their model _comma_ however _comma_ is not probabilistic _comma_ that is _comma_ it does not provide a probability estimate for unobserved cooccurrences .
4329,3,Using this method each tag is in 3 tripos and 2 bipos elements .
4330,3,Since F is a group _comma_ F is a semigroup .
4331,6,This lends quantitative support to research which suggests that motherese differs from normal adult speech in ways possibly useful to the language-learning infant Aslin et al. .
4332,3,What we need is occurrence frequencies of all word collocations .
4333,3,For each case _comma_ they were given the full set of nouns in the numbered category ( as shown above ) together with descriptions of the WordNet senses for the word to be disambiguated ( as _comma_ for example _comma_ the list of 25 senses for line given in the previous section _comma_ though thankfully few words have that many senses ! ) .
4334,2,Words unknown to the lexicon present a substantial problem to part-of-speech tagging .
4335,2,Therefore _comma_ we see no advantages to adopting their rule ; furthermore _comma_ they do not comment on what other laws have to be stipulated to account for the facts concerning other possible tense combinations .
4336,3,Two of the samples are those that Hobbs used when developing his algorithm .
4337,3,( In other words _comma_ that part of the f-structure that is associated with the NP node is re-entrant with the value of the subj feature in the f-structure associated with the S node .
4338,5,Barry and Pickering 1993 propose a calculus in which is dealt with using a product operation _comma_ and abstraction is limited to categories which do not act as a function in the derivation .
4339,3,This actually proves that the E  rule-set fully supercedes the Xerox rule-set .
4340,3,The bigram similarity model was also tested as a language model in speech recognition .
4341,3,You can buy an I R A if and only if you do NOT have an existing pension plan .
4342,5,Sibun 1990 implemented a system generating descriptions for objects with a strong domain structure _comma_ such as houses _comma_ chips and families .
4343,3,16_comma_000 + running words from section N of the Brown corpus ( texts N01 - N08 ) were hand-parsed using the state-transition grammar .
4344,5,The result was a system which comes very close to the formalised dependency grammars of Gaifman 1965 and Hays 1964 .
4345,3,Future work includes analyzing the corpus with respect to whether the IRU plays a role in the final plan that is negotiated between the conversants .
4346,3,For simplicity _comma_ we will assume that this abstraction is achieved by fronting the constituents in the post-surface-structure _comma_ although nothing much hinges on this ; our analysis is compatible with several possible mechanisms .
4347,3,While at first sight it appears left-recursive _comma_ inspection of its converted form shows its true leftmost subrule to be ` conjunction ' .
4348,3,Let  be the number of subrfrants of .
4349,3,Merge that pair of clusters  that entails the least additional cost _comma_ i.e. the smallest reduction in the value of for the subcorpus seen so far .
4350,2,Furthermore _comma_ one widely available example of a large _comma_ manually sense-tagged corpus -- the WordNet group 's annotated subset of the Brown corpus -- vividly illustrates the difficulty in obtaining suitable data .
4351,3,On the other hand _comma_ in this way it would be possible to detect the SRs holding on internal arguments .
4352,3,describes a state and describes a simple tense activity .
4353,3,We have classified 199 such French prepositions into 16 groups using in addition of our zones two other criteria :
4354,3,A similar comparison between RAND-FREE and DIST-FREE shows that distributional information alone also improves performance .
4355,5,Sguy 's earliest work was based on lexical correspondences : sites differed in the extent to which they used different words for the same concept .
4356,3,By these new roles constraints on the relations among semantic / pragmatic roles are known to be almost local within subordinate or main clause .
4357,3,The meaning of words _comma_ sentences _comma_ or even texts can be projected in a uniform way on Paradigme _comma_ as we have seen in Section  and .
4358,3,Garu is the present form and its root form is gar .
4359,7,We then develop a technique to allow analogous probabilistic annotations on type hierarchies .
4360,5,Most work in language modeling _comma_ including n-gram models and the Inside-Outside algorithm _comma_ falls under the maximum-likelihood paradigm _comma_ where one takes the objective function to be the likelihood of the training data given the grammar .
4361,3,If  for all nodes n in then we say that is valid in and write .
4362,5,Applications involving the understanding of dialogues include information extraction from conversational databases _comma_ or computer monitoring of conversations .
4363,3,The test text used to evaluate the German model described in section  has an ambiguity rate of 1.51 _comma_ this is _comma_ the lexicon provides an average of 1.51 tags for each word in the text .
4364,3,D3 All lexical probabilities have the same value _comma_ so that the lexicon contains no information other than the possible tags for each word .
4365,1,We have proposed a method of clustering words based on large corpus data .
4366,3,If a QLF expression contains uninstantiated meta-variables _comma_ the valuation relation can associate more than one value with the expression .
4367,3,The baseline back-off model follows closely the Katz design _comma_ except that for compactness all frequency one bigrams are ignored .
4368,3,manmosu `` mammoth '' is fully countable so the generic noun phrase is translated as a bare plural .
4369,7,Section  outlines hypotheses about the factors that affect which strategies are effective .
4370,3,The connective ` _comma_ ' is used to indicate that strings subsumed by two RHS clauses are ordered but not necessarily adjacent in the input .
4371,3,The data on which we compare the algorithms are important if we are to evaluate claims of generality .
4372,5,Strzalkowski 's Essential Arguments Approach ( EAA ) Strzalkowski 1993b is a top-down approach to generation and parsing with logic grammars that uses off-line compilation to automatically invert parser-oriented logic grammars .
4373,3,A parse tree for a sentence is constructed by starting with the sentence 's words as leaves of a tree structure _comma_ and labeling and extending nodes these nodes until a single-rooted _comma_ labeled tree is constructed .
4374,3,A feature structure approximates a morph iff the Moshier abstraction of the feature structure abstractly subsumes Carpenter 1992 the morph .
4375,4,Issues in sentence categorization according to language is fundamental for NLP _comma_ especially in document processing .
4376,2,The main reason is that Applicative CG is a much simpler formalism _comma_ which can be given a very simple syntax semantics interface _comma_ with function application in syntax mapping to function application in semantics  .
4377,1,In this paper _comma_ we have presented the robust parser with the extended least-errors recognition algorithm as the recovery mechanism .
4378,3,Our approach to parallelism is perhaps heavy-handed _comma_ but in the absence of a clear solutions _comma_ possibly more flexible .
4379,3,These examples demonstrate the importance of representing generalizations about left and right context separately .
4380,5,In Saito 1992 _comma_ she says that
4381,3,The second most frequent error type involves confusion of infinitives and 1 st and 3rd pers. pl. finite present tense forms .
4382,3,This entry would be underspecified _comma_ for example _comma_ the value of feature  would be specified to be any feature stored in the array entry for the substring whose feature f had the value a .
4383,5,Dalrymple et al. 1991 ( henceforth _comma_ DSP ) give an equational treatment of ellipsis via higher-order unification which _comma_ amongst other things _comma_ provides an insightful analysis of the interactions between ellipsis and quantification .
4384,3,Some care must therefore be taken in interpreting results .
4385,5,The independence assumption can also be made in the case of a class-based model or a slot-based model .
4386,5,In the second approach _comma_ the structure is :
4387,4,FSA of course generalizes such word lattices .
4388,3,Summaries are more frequent in ADs .
4389,3,All declarative sentences have been extracted for processing : about half were imperatives .
4390,3,Finally _comma_ we tease apart the relationship between dynamic semantics and incremental interpretation .
4391,3,The second experiment reveals that there are three distinct patterns of Baum-Welch re-estimation .
4392,3,is an equivalence class under .
4393,3,The preference values are the basis for giving priorities to items .
4394,3,These factors suggest that dependency grammar will play an increasingly important role as language processing systems seek to combine both structural and collocational information .
4395,3,to provide EVIDENCE to support the assumptions underlying the inference of mutual beliefs _comma_
4396,3,The example  below shows that the resolution of the anaphoric pronoun that must be performed first and that the PP starting with of be attached later .
4397,4,In many applications of natural language processing it is necessary to determine the likelihood of a given word combination .
4398,3,Paradigme can directly compute the similarity between any two words in LDV _comma_ and indirectly the similarity of all the other words in LDOCE .

4400,4,It is common among learners to make mistakes such as */kteb/ or  .
4401,3,At each step _comma_ universal instantiation and modus ponens are used .
4402,4,This can be seen by embedding each of these examples in a context that reinforces one of the meanings .
4403,5,It has often been stated that discourse is an inherently collaborative process and that this is manifested in certain phenomena _comma_ e.g. the use of anaphora and cue words Grosz and Sidner 1986 _comma_ Hirschberg and Litman 1987 _comma_ Cohen 1987 by which the speaker makes aspects of the discourse structure explicit .
4404,3,is defined as
4405,3,Bottom-up presentation operators are devised to simulate the unplanned aspect _comma_ where the next intermediate conclusion to be presented is chosen under the guidance of the local focus mechanism in a more spontaneous way .
4406,5,Propositions representing beliefs and intentions get added to the context by the unilateral action of one conversant _comma_
4407,2,However _comma_ none of these approaches is guaranteed to avoid protracted search times if an exact answer is required _comma_ because bag generation is NP-complete Brew 1992 .
4408,7,Finally _comma_ I present some results of experiments comparing SPATTER with a grammarian 's rule-based statistical parser _comma_ along with more recent results showing SPATTER applied to the Wall Street Journal domain .
4409,3,In short _comma_ as required _comma_ any attribute will have at most one value .
4410,4,The model is defined by two collections of parameters : the transition probabilities _comma_ which express the probability that a tag follows the preceding one ( or two for a second order model ) ; and the lexical probabilities _comma_ giving the probability that a word has a given tag without regard to words on either side of it .
4411,3,Since U is a subgroup of F _comma_  .
4412,3,Given these hypotheses _comma_ what is required is a way to test the hypothesized relationship of task and cognitive factors to effective discourse strategies .
4413,2,This is most obvious in _comma_ but is not limited to _comma_ sentences involving coordination .
4414,3,The algorithm applies equally to simple and complex utterances and sequences of utterances .
4415,2,His notion of similarity seems to agree with our intuitions in many cases _comma_ but it is not clear how it can be used directly to construct word classes and corresponding models of association .
4416,3,The simplest allows one to enumerate the possible analyses of the input with the grammar .
4417,3,The experiments show that when the method analyzes compound nouns with an average length 4.9 _comma_ it produces an accuracy rate of about 83 .

4419,1,This paper compares the Explicit-Warrant strategy to the All-Implicit strategy as strategies for supporting deliberation .
4420,3,Because our robust parser handle extragrammatical sentences with this syntactic information oriented recovery mechanism _comma_ it can be independent of a particular system or particular domain .
4421,4,For example _comma_ a speech recognizer may need to determine which of the two word combinations `` eat a peach '' and `` eat a beach '' is more likely .
4422,3,For typed feature structures lacking re-entrancy we believe our proposal to be the simplest and most natural which is available .
4423,4,In this derivation tree _comma_ the node labelled  is a distinguished descendant of the root and is the first point below at which the top symbol ( ) of the ( unbounded ) stack is exposed .
4424,3,Secondly _comma_ LFG grammars impose general constraints on various features in  .
4425,3,The significance of this restriction will be illustrated shortly .
4426,1,The rule formalism and compiler described here work well for European languages with reasonably complex orthographic changes but a limited range of possible affix combinations .
4427,5,The main impetus to change Applicative CG came from the work of Ades and Steedman 1982 .
4428,3,For most of the work described here the sentence was dynamically truncated 2 words beyond the hypertag marking the close of the subject .
4429,3,kazukazu-no implies that it 's modificant is made up of discrete entities _comma_ so the noun phrase it modifies should be translated as denumerated - plural .
4430,3,To overcome both of these problems we impose the following additional constraint on the productions of a grammar .
4431,5,By the strong plan-based account _comma_ we mean models where there is a set of personal goals which directly motivates all the behavior of the agent .
4432,7,Furthermore _comma_ we discuss how default handling can be adapted to multilingual generation _comma_ as required by the speech-to-speech translation system VERBMOBIL Block et al. 1992 .
4433,3,Now _comma_ the N-structure is combined with the V-structure of the introduced V-object as during normal processing .
4434,3,With the simple heuristic _comma_ good / close parses were returned in 24 out of the 53 sentences that involved some degree of skipping .
4435,3,An action that might occur or not-occur according to R is neither obligatory nor forbidden .
4436,3,We applied control criteria to four dialogues and identified 3 levels of discourse structure .
4437,1,To assess the practical performance of the three unification-based parsers described above _comma_ a series of experiments were conducted using the ANLT grammar Grover et al. 1993 _comma_ a wide-coverage grammar of English .
4438,3,Q is a finite subset of  _comma_
4439,5,In the first approach _comma_ adverbs of quantification ( Q-adverbs ) are assigned the structure :
4440,3,We write down a wff  which expresses all our desired grammatical constraints .
4441,4,As for the VP schema _comma_ it requires that the f-structure associated with the mother node is identical with the f-structure associated with the VP node .
4442,2,Syntactic natural language parsers have shown themselves to be inadequate for processing highly-ambiguous large-vocabulary text _comma_ as is evidenced by their poor performance on domains like the Wall Street Journal _comma_ and by the movement away from parsing-based approaches to text-processing in general .
4443,3,realizes a proposition whose antecedent was said by another conversant _comma_
4444,3,We have explored examples of the kinds of tree sets and string languages that this system can generate .
4445,3,Because a path through low-frequency words ( rare words ) implies a strong relation _comma_ it should be measured as a shorter path .
4446,3,Therefore in understanding the main clause we don't have to be care about semantic / pragmatic roles in subordinate clause other than a motivated .
4447,3,A subsumption ordering over QLFS _comma_  _comma_ is employed in the evaluation rules _comma_ in effect to propose possible instantiations for meta-variables ( the rule fragment only allows for scope meta-variables _comma_ but Cooper et al. 1994a describes the more general case where other kinds of meta-variable are permitted ) .
4448,3,F is a feature structure iff [ F is a quadruple  _comma_
4449,3,As an example _comma_ reconsider the string John likes Sue .
4450,3,Endings are not selected according to their frequency in running texts _comma_ because highly frequent words tend to have irregular endings _comma_ as shown by adverbs like jamais _comma_ toujours _comma_ peut-tre _comma_ hier _comma_ souvent ( never _comma_ always _comma_ maybe ) .
4451,3,Cutting up the parse trees will involve selecting a set of or-nodes in the and-or tree .
4452,3,That is why _comma_ the N-object cannot inherit a case value and also does not know whether it is allowed to occupy the front position in the utterance .
4453,3,With the aim of evaluating the effectiveness of shallow processing _comma_ tests will be carried out to see what proportion of different types of errors can be dealt with elegantly _comma_ adequately and / or efficiently .
4454,3,We argue that the resource sharing that is commonly manifest in the treatment of coordination in other approaches is appropriately handled by exploiting the structure-sharing in LFG f-structures .
4455,3,See Miller 1991 for a discussion of how this may be used for evaluation of functional programs by `` pushing '' the evaluation through abstractions to reduce redexes that are not at the top-level .
4456,5,labels the starting point of step .
4457,3,In addition to satisfying our first criterion _comma_ a finite-state grammar also fulfills the requirement that the formalism be radically lexicalist _comma_ as by definition every rule introduces a lexical item .
4458,3,The category also says that _comma_ for this kind of VP match _comma_ the term in the antecedent whose category identifies it as being the subject should be treated as parallel to the explicit term in the ellipsis .
4459,3,We refer to this extension as Partially Linear Indexed Grammars ( PLIG ) .
4460,1,As a subsidiary issue _comma_ we will also look at how the tagger performs on unknown words _comma_ i.e. ones not seen in the training data .
4461,3,From propositions  and .
4462,3,In particular _comma_ note that the F  decay seems to be to a non-zero asymptote _comma_ and that H and L appear to have different asymptotes which we symbolise as h and l respectively .
4463,3,There is a second analysis for the tree by the brook _comma_ due to rule 5 _comma_ which has been obtained by ignoring the sequence tree by the .
4464,3,We imagine hypotheses represented as a string of ones and zeros .
4465,5,If there are k rules in the grammar and thus k parameters _comma_ then the search takes place in a fixed k-dimensional space  .
4466,5,For this kind of example _comma_ it is still possible to use a standard dynamic semantics _comma_ but only if there is some prior level of reference resolution which reorders the antecedents and anaphors appropriately .
4467,3,The model is trained using a set of initial transition biases _comma_ including both positive and negative constraints on tag sequences .
4468,5,Thus we have an appropriate level to perform substring coordination .
4469,3,As a guiding heuristic we will avoid formalisms that generate tree sets with an unbounded number of unbounded _comma_ dependent branches .
4470,3,Empty constituents in the syntax are not in themselves referential _comma_ but are recovered during Common Topic inference .
4471,2,To my knowledge _comma_ no previous work on dialogue has ever argued that conversational agents ' resource limits are a major factor in determining effective conversational strategies in collaboration .
4472,3,Virtually almost every word which can be guessed by the morphological rules is guessed exactly correct ( 97 % recall and 97 % precision ) .
4473,5,Applicative Categorial Grammars allow categories to have arguments which are themselves functions ( e.g. very can be treated as a function of a function _comma_ and given the type (n/n)/(n/n) when used as an adjectival modifier ) .
4474,4,For each rule  there are rules _comma_ for all .
4475,3,To see this _comma_ assume ( by induction ) that all four of the daughter nonterminals are associated with the full binary tree of height i (  ) .
4476,3,The focus is on these two issues ; no attempt is being made to produce a complete product .
4477,3,The problem here is determining which thread in  they continue ; continues the thread in which Sam rings the bell _comma_ but continues the thread in which Sam loses the key .
4478,3,In particular _comma_ much of one 's behavior arises from a sense of obligation to behave within limits set by the society that the agent is part of .
4479,1,This claim is justified by constructing a parser _comma_ called SPATTER ( Statistical PATTErn Recognizer ) _comma_ based on very limited linguistic information _comma_ and comparing its performance to a state-of-the-art grammar-based parser on a common task .
4480,3,Proof : as given in Figure
4481,3,The model handles errors vocalisation _comma_ diacritics _comma_ phonetic syncopation and morphographemic idiosyncrasies _comma_ in addition to Damerau errors .
4482,3,The task of the algorithm is to generate all such structures and to equip them with probabilities .
4483,3,From the result of the previous section _comma_ each conjunct must share not just the phonological material _comma_ but also the syntactic structure and the lexical meanings .
4484,3,I also wish to thank the NLP group at SICS for contributing to a very conductive atmosphere to work in _comma_ and in particular Ivan Bretan for valuable comments on draft versions of this article .
4485,3,Our scheme is based on the assumption that words that are `` similar '' to  can provide good predictions for the distribution of in unseen bigrams .
4486,3,The LF for found shown in  would be represented as .
4487,3,The pattern which is applicable can be predicted from the quality of the initial model and the similarity between the tagged training corpus ( if any ) and the corpus to be tagged .
4488,3,The required inductive definition is as follows :
4489,5,For bigrams the resulting estimator has the general form
4490,3,It appears that the class of languages generated by PLTG is included in those languages generated by Linear Context-Free Rewriting Systems Vijay-Shanker et al. 1987 since the construction involved in a proof of this underlies the recognition algorithm discussed in the next section .
4491,3,The claim here is that one class of IRU 's addresses these assumptions underlying the inference of mutual understanding .
4492,3,V_AND_NP_LIST : Contains content words found in this DCU _comma_ and is used to compare the content words of the current DCU with those in previous threads _comma_ in order to rate the semantic `` closeness '' of the DCU to each thread .
4493,3,The penalty for a substituted word was set to 0.9 _comma_ so that substituting a word would be preferable to skipping the word .
4494,3,This was reflected in different distribution of anaphora in the two cases .
4495,3,In fact _comma_ the number of dependent branches is bounded by the length of the right-hand-side of productions .
4496,3,Such a strategy allows the user to perform processing of results between these layers _comma_ which can be useful in trying to find the ` best ' analyses first .
4497,3,These are problems with :
4498,3,However when there is no evidence to the contrary _comma_ and goals of the discourse require achievement of acceptance _comma_ inferences about acceptance are licensed as default .
4499,1,In this paper _comma_ we describe a corpus-based induction algorithm for probabilistic context-free grammars that outperforms n-gram models and the Inside-Outside algorithm Baker 1979 in medium-sized domains .
4500,3,one or more RHS clauses may be marked as optional ;
4501,3,The ambiguity rate for this text is 1.41 .
4502,4,As illustrative examples _comma_ consider the following sentences .
4503,3,Then _comma_ in the structure reduction stage _comma_ the system recursively cuts out the nodes _comma_ from the terminal nodes _comma_ which are imposed the highest penalty .
4504,3,Our off-line grammar optimization is based on a generalization of the dataflow analysis employed in the DIA to a dataflow analysis for typed feature structure grammars .
4505,3,Thus there are two parts to this paper : we present the quantitative results of hand-simulating these algorithms ( henceforth Hobbs algorithm and Brennan et al. algorithm ) _comma_ but this analysis naturally gives rise to both a qualitative evaluation and recommendations for performing such evaluations in general .
4506,3,More natural examples where conjuncts are formed by fragments from different constituents are the following :
4507,3,Their accuracy is not even as good as that achieved by picking the most frequent tag ( although this of course implies a lexicon of D0 or D1 quality ) .
4508,2,Choosing initial biases to help train a model is a subtle task in that it not only requires sound knowledge of the tag set used and the target language the model is aiming at _comma_ but it also requires a `` feel '' for how the initial biases may be modified during a given number of training iterations .
4509,3,noun vs. verb ( share _comma_ offer _comma_ plan ) _comma_
4510,3,where  is thickness of the k-th link of _comma_ and is activity ( at time T ) of the node referred by the k-th link of .
4511,3,Instead it is a simple matter of using the meta-level  - reduction to eliminate - redexes to produce the final result .
4512,5,A naive adaptation of this algorithm for LIG recognition would involve storing a set of nonterminals and their associated stacks .
4513,3,In that figure _comma_ `  ' means that each word is recognized in the general world however a verb ` yomu ' introduced a special membrane as a subworld of W. Each DAG means a polymorphic type of the lexical item .
4514,3,Computational tractability is further addressed by reducing data through the application of prohibitive rules as local constraints .
4515,3,For example _comma_ expressions like `` ... 3 reasons . First _comma_ ... Second _comma_ ... Third _comma_ ... '' _comma_ and `` ... Of course _comma_ ... But _comma_ ... '' are extracted and the structural constraint is added onto the sequence so as to form a chunk between the expressions .
4516,1,This paper is interested in exploring the amenability of using a method for extracting SRs from textual data _comma_ in the line of these works .
4517,4,Observe _comma_ however _comma_ that such a bottom-up synthesis of a new unsaturated type is only required _comma_ if that type is to be consumed ( as the antecedent of an implication ) by another type .
4518,3,It is also necessary to modify the termination criterion as was done for the function  above .
4519,3,For example _comma_ we cannot say voyager sur place-to travel in place .
4520,3,There are probably many reasons why performance is much better than the complexity results suggest _comma_ but the most important may be that :
4521,7,This uncovered some important constraints on the form of the phrase structure rules ( phrase structure rules ) in a grammar imposed by the compiler ( section  ) .
4522,4,A then plans to achieve the goal _comma_ thereby generating the answer .
4523,3,The discriminant function extracted from the data by the analysis is a linear combination of the parameters .
4524,5,Cawsey et al. 1993 _comma_ Logan et al. 1994 introduced the idea of utilizing a belief revision mechanism Galliers 1992 to predict whether a set of evidence is sufficient to change a user 's existing belief and to generate responses for information retrieval dialogues in a library domain .
4525,5,Similarity-based estimation was first used for language modeling in the cooccurrence smoothing method of Essen and Steinbiss 1992 _comma_ derived from work on acoustic model smoothing by Sugawara et al. 1985 .
4526,5,Kneser and Ney 1993 present a probabilistic model for entropy maximization that also relies on the immediate neighbors of words in a corpus .
4527,3,will generate strings of tags including :
4528,1,How might one evaluate the relative contributions of each of these factors or compare two approaches to the same problem ?
4529,3,while  is not empty .
4530,3,However _comma_ explicit cues to rhetorical and temporal relations are not always available _comma_ and these cases result in more ambiguity than is desirable when processing large discourses .
4531,3,The meaning constructor for supported combines with  to derive the formula for bill-supported shown in .
4532,3,This completes our mathematical picture of LFG ontology .
4533,1,Once the ontological issues have been settled we turn to our ultimate goal : providing a specification language for LFG grammars .
4534,5,For example _comma_ instead of judging bank as a financial institution as more plausible than bank as a riverbank in the noun phrase the rich bank _comma_ we can compare the number of co-occurrences of the lexemes rich and bank  ( = riverbank ) versus rich and bank ( = financial institution ) in a semantically analysed corpus .
4535,5,Given a baseline probability model P _comma_ which is taken to be the MLE _comma_ the confusion probability  between conditioning words and is defined as
4536,3,D0 Un-degraded lexical probabilities _comma_ calculated from  .
4537,5,Similar research includes work by Cook et al. 1976 and Stolcke and Omohundro 1994 .
4538,3,one of them _comma_ one of those _comma_ a new one _comma_ that one _comma_ the other one _comma_ some
4539,4,For instance _comma_ consider one simple phenomena : a question is typically followed by an answer _comma_ or some explicit statement of an inability or refusal to answer .
4540,1,We described measurement of semantic similarity between words .
4541,3,Finally there was evidence for high level structures in these dialogues as evidenced by topic initiation and control _comma_ with early topics being initiated and dominated by the client and the opposite being true for the later parts .
4542,3,For example _comma_ if a simple past eventive sentence follows a simple past eventive sentence the second event can be understood to occur just after the first _comma_ to precede the first or to refer to the same event as the first ( an elaboration relation ) _comma_ but the two events cannot overlap ; these constraints are weaker _comma_ however _comma_ than explicit clues such as cue words to rhetorical relations and temporal expressions .
4543,3,This pattern recognition process is driven by the decision-tree models described in the previous section .
4544,3,If  is in a head-part _comma_ let be doubled .
4545,3,From R-relation  ) and formula _comma_ we derive _comma_ giving the meaning of the subject of f
4546,3,We have recently conducted some new experiments to test the utility of the GLR* parser and our parse evaluation heuristics when parsing speech recognized spontaneous speech in the ATIS domain .
4547,1,This paper represents a step toward getting as much leverage as possible out of work within that paradigm _comma_ and then using it to help determine relationships among word senses _comma_ which is really where the action is .
4548,3,From this information _comma_ a user might wish to rank the three results according to their respective span : coverage ratios _comma_ probably preferring the second .
4549,1,The next section sets out some of the properties that we might require from such a `` performance grammar '' and offers a formalism which attempts to satisfy these requirements .
4550,3,The first of these has analysed the island you the tree by the brook _comma_ ignoring the tree _comma_ while the second has analysed the tree by the brook _comma_ consuming all terminals .
4551,5,Cooccurrence probabilities of words are then modeled by averaged cooccurrence probabilities of word clusters .
4552,3,Hypertags are always inserted in pairs _comma_ so that closure is enforced .
4553,2,However _comma_ this does not capture important structural properties of natural language .
4554,3,The following wff is valid on precisely those models satisfying the completeness principle :
4555,3,This principle claims that evidence of conflict should be made apparent in order to keep default inferences about acceptance or understanding from going through .
4556,3,The constraints that we identify for the tree-based system can be regarded equally well as constraints on unification-based grammar formalisms such as PATR Shieber 1984 .
4557,3,Once we have this mechanism _comma_ we can use it to construct interpretations of sentences like  - .
4558,5,For example _comma_ the semantics of  would be _comma_ which would then get simplified to .
4559,3,other agent 's beliefs _comma_ preferences and goals .
4560,5,For this model error rates of  ( depending on the coverage of the underlying lexicon ) were reported .
4561,3,Each rule name is turned into the name of a Prolog clause _comma_ and additional arguments are added to it .
4562,3,Note that the tree shown in Figure  is unobtainable because the branch rooted at is dependent on more than one of the branches originating at its sibling .
4563,3,A module realizing this scheme has been implemented and applied to the very setup used for the previous experiments with the hand-coded tree-cutting criteria Samuelsson 1994a .
4564,5,For example _comma_ the definition for dictionary is `` a book in which the words of a language are listed alphabetically ... ''
4565,3,If the overall confidence value exceeds some set value _comma_ the agent 's confidence threshold _comma_ then the agent believes the plan is adequate .
4566,3,They are added onto the sequence produced in step 2 _comma_ and form restrictions for generating structures in step 4 .
4567,2,However _comma_ possible computational applications have received less attention .
4568,3,A pronoun coindexing procedure which replaces pronoun variables with a variable from the same sentence _comma_ or from the preceding context .
4569,5,Alternatively _comma_ one could adopt a pure bottom-up strategy like the one which has been proposed in Shieber 1988 and which is presented in Fig. in a highly schematic manner .
4570,5,Although stacks of unbounded size can arise during a derivation _comma_ it is not possible for a to specify that two dependent _comma_ unbounded stacks must appear at distinct places in the derivation tree .
4571,5,After responding with the surface actions of the plan _comma_ it updates the state of the collaboration _comma_ presupposing that the other copy will accept the plan .
4572,3,Each step is discussed and illustrated in figure  .
4573,3,For our initial grammar _comma_ we choose a grammar that can generate any string _comma_ to assure that the grammar can cover the training data .
4574,3,Guessing the possible semantic classes _comma_ i.e. creation of the space of candidates .
4575,3,depending if they focus on the initial location _comma_ on the path or on the final location of the motion .
4576,3,where function l and r return the left and right subtree of the tree respectively _comma_ cat returns thesaurus categories of the argument .
4577,4,Catching on to the above example _comma_ there can be a negation specifier given at the end of the Japanese input sentence which cannot be simply integrated into the output sentence because the finite verb has already been uttered .
4578,3,In addition _comma_ I plan to explore alternative measures of semantic similarity _comma_ for example an improved variant on simple path length that has been proposed by Leacock and Chodorow 1994 .
4579,3,Each pragmatic inference is associated with a set of necessary conditions that may trigger that inference .
4580,3,Among them _comma_ connective expressions _comma_ which state inter-sentence relationships _comma_ are the most significant .
4581,3,At present _comma_ the coverage of module  is limited _comma_ and module is a naive coindexing procedure which allows a pronoun to be coindexed with any quantified variable or proper noun in the context or the current sentence .
4582,2,Also in Palmer 1986 its semantics is informally explained _comma_ however our proposal is to formalize garu 's semantics in UG or more generally in computational linguistics .
4583,3,A nucleus is defined as a structure containing a preparatory process _comma_ culmination and consequent state .
4584,3,Third _comma_ we wanted to evaluate the ability of the parse quality heuristic to correctly classify GLR* parses as `` good '' or `` bad '' .
4585,3,It does not depend on training sets and converges fast enough to achieve very good results on sentences .
4586,6,The bilingual dual-coding theory Paivio 1986 partially answers the above questions .
4587,3,Finally _comma_ it argued that the apparently close relationship between the states used in incremental semantics and dynamic semantics fails to hold below the sentence level _comma_ and briefly presented a more indirect way of using dynamic semantics in incremental interpretation .
4588,2,As Shieber 1988 noted _comma_ the main shortcoming of Earley generation is a lack of goal-directedness that results in a proliferation of edges .
4589,3,If we allow any of the four possible temporal relations between events _comma_ both continuations of sentence  would have 17 readings ( 4 x 4 + 1 reading in which the third sentence begins a new thread ) .
4590,3,The degree of nondeterminacy the grammar is allowed to introduce is originally set to one and consecutively incremented until the optimal evaluation order for all rules in the grammar is found .
4591,4,Alternatively _comma_ there may be no need to provide as powerful a mechanism as two-level morphology at all ; a simpler device such as affix stripping Alshawi 1992 or merely listing all inflected forms explicitly may be preferable .
4592,5,One of the relevant researches to ours is JPSG that has been developed by Gunji 1987 _comma_ Gunji 1989 and is further studied by the ICOT working group .
4593,3,Obligations do not replace the plan-based model _comma_ but augment it .
4594,3,Thus _comma_ for the subject detection task :
4595,3,Some examples : Nouns in cluster 0 are heads of larger noun phrases _comma_ whereas the nouns in cluster 1 are full-fledged NPs .
4596,3,Instead _comma_ we briefly compare the current work to three previous studies that explicitly tie ellipsis resolution to an account of discourse structure and coherence _comma_ namely our previous account Kehler 1993b and the accounts of Pruest 1992 and Asher 1993 .
4597,2,We formalize this theory in UG formalism _comma_ even though the details are omitted due to the space limitation .
4598,5,Certain researchers in the psycholinguistic community Pritchett 1992 _comma_ Gorrell in press _comma_ have argued for a binary distinction between two distinct types of garden path sentences .
4599,3,So the data that this paper focuses on accounts for about 30 % of the data .
4600,5,Several researchers have worked on learning grammatical properties of words .
4601,3,The list of terminal nodes of the final structure becomes an abstract for the original document .
4602,3,There is a plausible model theoretic strategy strategy for extending our account to cover  ; but the nature of the required extension clearly shows that is of a quite different character to the bulk of LFG .
4603,3,The input to the net is derived from the candidate strings _comma_ the sequences of tags and hypertags .
4604,4,Insertions add extra information _comma_ usually modifiers e.g.
4605,5,The advantages of the latter are clear .
4606,3,The model of limited resources is cognitively based _comma_ but the cost parameters support modeling different agent architectures _comma_ and we explored the effects of different cost parameters .
4607,3,Finally _comma_ our procedure induces a `` hard '' part-of-speech classification of occurrences in context _comma_ i.e. _comma_ each occurrence is assigned to only one category .
4608,2,This paper has sketched various problems with some of the linguistic accounts of coordination .
4609,3,( Note that  = 2:1 . )
4610,3,If successful _comma_ such an approach has obvious benefits : one can use whatever sources of good word groupings are available -- primarily unsupervised word clustering methods _comma_ but also on-line thesauri and the like -- without folding in the complexity of dealing with word senses at the same time .
4611,3,In short _comma_ in common with most of the grammatical formalisms with which we are familiar _comma_ LFG seems to have a dynamic residue that resists a purely declarative analysis .
4612,3,It should be apparent from the account that the types of utterances examined here are not really redundant .
4613,3,Then _comma_ when the first four words are recognized _comma_ they can form a complete sentence of  .
4614,3,Since they are more accurate than ending-guessing rules they are applied before ending-guessing rules and improve the precision of the guessings by about 5 % .
4615,3,Definition 22 .
4616,3,There is also only a single level of representation ( which is explicitly constructed for output purposes but not consulted by the parser ) .
4617,5,The atlas is therefore an approximate reconstruction of the linguistic landscape of the turn of the century _comma_ when the Gaeltacht was more continuous .
4618,3,Clearly _comma_ if the expected pattern is initial maximum _comma_ we should not use BW at all _comma_ if early maximum _comma_ we should halt the process after a few iterations _comma_ and if classical _comma_ we should halt the process in a `` standard '' way _comma_ such as comparing the perplexity of successive models .
4619,3,and verb vs. adjective ( fehlgeschlagen _comma_ bekannt ) _comma_
4620,3,Both programs involve search _comma_ and in general _comma_ the aim in searching is to discover the values for  so as to optimise the value of a specified evaluation function .
4621,5,Since the description before the processing of the disambiguating word hurts is a subset of the final tree description _comma_ the monotonicity requirement is satisfied .
4622,3,Previous knowledge used
4623,5,Off-line compilation of logic grammars using Magic allows an incorporation of filtering into the logic underlying the grammar .
4624,5,The grammar induction algorithms most successful in language modeling include the Inside-Outside algorithm Lari and Young 1990 _comma_ Lari and Young 1991 _comma_ Pereira and Schabes 1992 _comma_ a special case of the Expectation-Maximization algorithm Dempster et al. 1977 _comma_ and work by McCandless 1993 .
4625,3,In particular _comma_ in many tasks it is at least as important to avoid inappropriate senses than to select exactly the right one .
4626,5,An example would be that `` and '' or `` but '' signal to the listener that a new topic and set of referents is being introduced whereas `` anyway '' and `` in any case '' indicate a return to a previous topic and referent set .
4627,2,Restating the first problem noted in Section  _comma_ if treating the simple past as anaphoric is used to account for the forward progression of time in passage ( _comma_ then one would expect the existence of the Explanation relation in passage to cause a temporal clash _comma_ where in fact passage is perfectly felicitous .
4628,3,Apart from anything else _comma_ ` representative ' is hard to decide - spectrum of errors or distribution of errors ?
4629,3,The question _comma_ now _comma_ is what should this function look like ?
4630,3,But this trade-off _comma_ and the effectiveness of different clustering algorithms _comma_ can be monitored and optimized by applying the resulting cluster-based language models to unseen test data .
4631,3,By using a careful distinction between the different notions of reference time _comma_ based on Kamp and Reyle 1993 _comma_ we propose a solution to this problem _comma_ within the framework of DRT .
4632,3,Applicability Condition :
4633,6,The version of the Xerox tagger used for the implementation described here is the DDS Tagger version 1.1 Kupiec and Wilkens 1994 .
4634,3,we can then parse papers to Joe using the transitions :
4635,4,For example _comma_ English inflectional morphology is relatively simple ; dimensions  and are fairly small _comma_ so if _comma_ the lexicon _comma_ is known in advance and is of manageable size _comma_ then the entire task of morphological analysis can be carried out at compile time _comma_ producing a list of analysed word forms which need only be looked up at run time _comma_ or a network which can be traversed very simply .
4636,3,In the newspaper articles tested _comma_ there were an average of 7.0 noun phrases in each sentence .
4637,3,To modify the Assoc in such a way that it was based in a likelihood ratio test Dunning 1993 .
4638,5,The MLE for the probability of a bigram  is simply :
4639,2,Our focus is a more pragmatics oriented one than JPSG is .
4640,3,The method to acquire collocational information is dependent on the Japanese character _comma_ but the method to calculate preferences of structures si applicable to any language with compound nouns .
4641,3,However constraining equations broaden the scope of the permitted discourse ; basically _comma_ they allow implicit appeal to possible derivational structure .
4642,3,SVD can be used to approximate the row and column vectors of C in a low-dimensional space .
4643,3,The author wishes to thank Dale Gerdemann _comma_ Mark Johnson _comma_ Thilo Goetz and the anonymous reviewers for valuable comments and discussion .
4644,3,To categorize a set into N categories N - 1 functions need to be determined .
4645,3,with  _comma_ and with the focus set as the description ( including the semantic analysis ) of the focussed phrase man .
4646,3,In the case where lexical entries have been associated with preference information _comma_ this information can be exploited to guide the heuristic search .
4647,3,We analysed both financial and support ADs .
4648,3,Notice that while the feature structures at the root of  and are not compatible with and _comma_ they do agree with respect to those parts that are fully expanded at 's root node .
4649,1,In this paper _comma_ we describe an alternative generation component which has polynomial time complexity .
4650,3,In terms of hits _comma_ false alarms and misses _comma_ we have :
4651,2,The difficulty with the latter kind of knowledge is that _comma_ until now _comma_ the widespread success in characterizing lexical behavior in terms of distributional relationships has applied at the level of words -- indeed _comma_ word forms -- as opposed to senses .
4652,5,For instance _comma_ in Hinrich 's Hinrichs 1986 proposal _comma_ accomplishments and achievements introduce a new reference point that is temporally ordered after the time of the event itself _comma_ `` ensuring that two consecutive accomplishments or achievements in a discourse are always ordered in a temporal sequence . ''
4653,7,The paper is structured as follows .
4654,1,tense is resolved indefinitely with respect to a possibly anaphorically-resolved discourse reference time _comma_ and
4655,3,The examples presented in Section  are encouraging in this regard : in addition to performing well at the task of assigning a high score to the best sense _comma_ it does a good job of assigning low scores to senses that are clearly inappropriate .
4656,3,However _comma_ clustering can have two important uses .
4657,3,The resulting transition diagram is as follows :
4658,3,Here _comma_ the sub-rule ` conjunction ( Conj ) ' is marked as a head and is therefore evaluated before either of ` s ( Sl ) ' or ` s ( Sr ) ' :
4659,1,The aim of the proposed technique is to learn the SRs that a word is imposing _comma_ from the analysis of the examples of use of that word contained in the corpus .
4660,3,Each node must be tested no more than twice in the worst case ( due to precedence monotonicity ) _comma_ as one might have to try to combine its children in either direction according to the grammar rules .
4661,5,A word vector is defined as the list of distances from a word to a certain set of selected words _comma_ which we call origins .
4662,3,Regrettably _comma_ the LL data was only available from isolated disyllables _comma_ and other sequences such as LH and H  H were not available at all .
4663,5,Mellish 1989 introduced some chart-based techniques using only syntactic information for extragrammatical sentences .
4664,4,Word vectors reflecting word meanings are expected to enable numerical approaches to semantics .
4665,3,The relationship of cue words _comma_ intonational contour Pierrehumbert and Hirschberg 1990 and the use of modal subordination Roberts 1986 to the segments derived from the control rules is a topic for future research .
4666,3,We do not care about other words that might be generated by  .
4667,3,a local threshold level may be set in a rule to override the global threshold within that rule .
4668,3,Clearly _comma_ the more two agents agree on the rules _comma_ the smoother the interaction becomes _comma_ and some rules are clearly virtually universal .
4669,2,It is quite small _comma_ by current corpus standards ( on the order of hundreds of thousands of words _comma_ rather than millions or tens of millions ) ; the direct annotation methodology used to create it is labor intensive ( Marcus et al. 1993 found that direct annotation takes twice as long as automatic tagging plus correction _comma_ for part-of-speech annotation ) ; and the output quality reflects the difficulty of the task ( inter-annotator disagreement is on the order of 10 % _comma_ as contrasted with the approximately 3 % error rate reported for part-of-speech annotation by Marcus et al. ) .
4670,3,We test on 500 sentences _comma_ and measure performance by the entropy of the test data .
4671,3,We ran the parser three times on the test set .
4672,3,We denote trees with first order terms .
4673,5,It is an inherent feature of phrase structure grammars that they classify the strings of words from a language into two ( infinite ) sets _comma_ one containing the grammatical strings and the other the ungrammatical strings .
4674,3,Accordingly _comma_ the table for R would be as follows :
4675,3,Figure  gives a schematic example of a grammar that does not obey the dependency constraint .
4676,3,We duplicate the meaning of two candidates using QNP Duplication _comma_ and combine one copy with the foregoing formula to yield :
4677,3,We also address compositional semantics for motion complexes ( ie. a motion verb followed by a spatial preposition ) and show that the complexity and the refinements of the linguistic studies presented just before are justified and required at the compositional level in order to capture the different behaviours in the compositional processes that exist with the French language .
4678,3,Even for `` natural '' contexts _comma_ performance varies considerably .
4679,3,Thus _comma_ no rules are given for evaluating terms or their indices in isolation .
4680,4,A description is an entity that can be interpreted as true or false of an object _comma_ and using feature structures as descriptions accrues several computational benefits .
4681,3,In this restriction is ` built in ' : it follows from the choices made concerning the mathematical objects composing models .
4682,2,There is no lack of competing competence grammars available _comma_ but also no reason to expect that such grammars should be suited to a DOP approach _comma_ designed as they were to characterize the nature of linguistic competence rather than performance .
4683,4,The use of corpus clustering often does not boost the power of the knowledge source as much as a specific hand-coded extension .
4684,2,Such grammars are poor language models _comma_ as they overfit the training data and do not model the language at large .
4685,3,We discuss cases such as :
4686,3,We view the problem of learning case frame patterns as that of learning a multi-dimensional discrete joint distribution _comma_ where random variables represent case slots .
4687,5,Each rule has a probability  and the probabilities for all the rules that expand a given non-terminal must sum to one .
4688,3,The word `` waters '' could be a 3rd person _comma_ singular _comma_ present verb or a plural noun .
4689,3,So our next goal is to extract morphological rules with one letter mutations at the end .
4690,4,Such generalizations are _comma_ of course _comma_ central to qualitative structural approaches to translation Isabelle and Macklovitch 1986 _comma_ Alshawi et al. 1992 .
4691,4,Rather the speaker must infer whether the hearer understands and accepts the current contribution based on indirect evidence provided by the hearer 's next dialogue contribution .
4692,3,Table  shows the incidence of the diagnostic types in the testing sample .
4693,2,Although processing accounts can provide reasonable coverage of the coordination data _comma_ the exact predictions often require detailed examination of the code .
4694,2,To our knowledge _comma_ neither algorithm has surpassed the performance of n-gram models in a language modeling task of substantial scale .
4695,3,In this sense _comma_ the observed soa 's argument role is observed .
4696,3,As for lhip_mc_phrases / 4 _comma_ except that Ps is additionally the set of parses with the least span .
4697,3,a definition of the tag set to be used by the HMM _comma_
4698,5,The mechanism used to account for this phenomena in Hinrichs 1986 and Partee 1984 _comma_ is based on the notion of reference time _comma_ originally proposed by Reichenbach 1947 .
4699,5,In it _comma_ NP denotes NOUN PHRASE and S denotes SENTENCE .
4700,2,The second question arises from assuming that all temporal relations are recovered solely from reasoning with coherence relations .
4701,4,It is widely acknowledged that a full account of natural language utterances cannot be given in terms of only syntactic or semantic phenomena .
4702,3,features : ( top-down compulsory implicit ) .
4703,3,Some problems associated with tagging unknown words in inflected languages are briefly considered .
4704,3,count occurrence frequencies for each collocational pattern of thesaurus categories .
4705,5,For instance _comma_ one may estimate the likelihood of a particular direct object for a verb from the likelihoods of that direct object for similar verbs .
4706,3,Thus _comma_ using the abstract syntax capabilities of  -Prolog _comma_ we can have a direct implementation of the underlying linguistic formalism _comma_ in stark contrast to the first-order simulation shown in Figure .
4707,1,Within a current project on adapting bilingual dictionaries for online comprehension assistance ( COMPASS _comma_ LRE 62 - 080 ) _comma_ the need arose for a POS-disambiguator to facilitate a context sensitive dictionary look-up system .
4708,3,In addition _comma_ we provide a process for selecting among multiple possible pieces of evidence .
4709,3,There are three avenues of future research we are interested in pursuing .
4710,4,do away with subjectivity inherent in a hand made thesaurus _comma_ and
4711,3,Thirdly _comma_ it can be applied in a standard way across knowledge sources for very different kinds of object _comma_ and if it does improve on the unclustered model this constitutes proof that additional _comma_ as yet unexploited relationships exist between linguistic objects of the type the model is based on _comma_ and that therefore it is worth looking for a more specific _comma_ more powerful way to model them .
4712,3,captures the negotiation process in a recursive Propose-Evaluate-Modify cycle of actions _comma_ thus enabling the system to handle embedded negotiation subdialogues .
4713,3,Fortunately _comma_ these figures are sufficient to determine the R values for all other pairs of tones in Bamileke Dschang .
4714,3,In other cases _comma_ where participants perceive obstacles to their goals being achieved _comma_ they resort to interruptions and we have tried to make explicit the rules by which they do this .
4715,3,The aim of this paper is also to point that the more the linguistic properties of the object are used _comma_ the best the results are .
4716,3,can precede e if
4717,6,Earley deduction is a very attractive framwork for natural language processing because it has the following properties and applications .
4718,3,However this simple-minded approach _comma_ although easy to implement _comma_ in other ways leaves much to be desired .
4719,3,To make this concrete _comma_ there are five tokens of the word ` dog ' in the examples thus far _comma_ and so ` dog ' will have the transition probability distribution :
4720,3,The rhetorical structure provides a natural order of importance among sentences in the text _comma_ and can be used to determine which sentence should be extracted in the abstract _comma_ according to the desired length of the abstract .
4721,3,Finally _comma_ we will try the current system on samples from other languages _comma_ to make sure this method generalizes appropriately .
4722,4,Consider Figure  .
4723,3,For example _comma_ `` fun '' in `` It 's a fun thing to do . '' has properties of both a noun and an adjective ( superlative `` funnest '' possible ) .
4724,5,This model is interesting in that it does not allow the parser to employ delay tactics _comma_ such as using a lookahead buffer Marcus 1980 _comma_ Marcus et al. 1983 _comma_ or waiting for the head of a phrase to appear in the input before constructing that phrase Abney 1987 _comma_ Abney 1989 _comma_ Pritchett 1992 .
4725,3,The hierarchical planning is realized by so-called top-down presentation operators that split the task of presenting a particular proof into subtasks of presenting subproofs .
4726,3,Consider the following pair of sentences :
4727,3,But agents ' autonomy means there are a number of other reasons why A 's utterance to B conveying a proposition p might not achieve its intended effect :
4728,3,Now suppose that we have a sequence T of tones where  is the ith tone ( H or L ) and a sequence X of F values where is the F value corresponding to .
4729,3,Two types of mis-taggings caused by the guessers occured .
4730,3,The symbols + IndP _comma_ + SG and + P 3 are then transduced to the void symbol _comma_ so that vient ( or even the new token vient - ) gets analysed merely as + VERB-P 3 SG instead of + IndP + SG + P 3 + Verb .
4731,3,In the sentence evaluation stage _comma_ the system calculate the importance of each sentence in the original text based on the relative importance of rhetorical relations .
4732,3,These endings belong to the most frequent ending patterns in the lexicon _comma_ where every rare word weights as much as any frequent word .
4733,3,Each state is a recursively defined category _comma_ similar to a category in Categorial Grammar .
4734,3,all basic wffs are wffs _comma_
4735,5,For example _comma_ ATNs were adapted by Woods 1973 _comma_ DCGs by Dahl and McCord 1983 _comma_ and chart parsers by Haugeneder 1992 .
4736,3,This formula is satisfied in a model at any node m iff m is labeled with the category S _comma_ has exactly two daughters  and labeled with category NP and VP respectively .
4737,3,That is _comma_ the mathematical entities we introduce should clearly reflect the intuitions important to LFG theorising -- `` No coding ! '' _comma_ should be our slogan .
4738,3,Main verb tenses are indefinitely referential _comma_ creating a new temporal entity under constraints imposed by its type ( i.e. _comma_ past _comma_ present _comma_ or future ) in relation to a discourse reference time  .
4739,3,They are categorized into three types as shown in Table  .
4740,5,See figure  .
4741,2,In this study _comma_ not only has the technique proved its worth by supporting generality _comma_ but through generalisation of training information it outperforms the equivalent lexical association approach given the same information .
4742,6,Thus _comma_ we base our model on the work of Clark and Wilkes-Gibbs 1986 _comma_ and Heeman and Hirst 1992 who both modeled ( the first psychologically _comma_ and the second computationally ) how people collaborate on reference to objects for which they have mutual knowledge .
4743,3,contributes to a theory of dialogue by showing how mutual beliefs can be inferred in the absence of the master-slave assumption .
4744,3,If they are realized with question intonation _comma_ the inference of acceptance is blocked .
4745,3,The problem arises as a result of the fact that these solutions lead to identical filters for the evaluation of the cat_3 literal _comma_ i.e. _comma_ the solutions to cat_2 do not uniquely determine cat_3 .
4746,3,The fact that we have two possible tables for R is no cause for alarm .
4747,3,For practical grammar engineering one can devise the motto avoid accumulation of unbounded dependencies by whatever means .
4748,3,where  .
4749,3,The last column gives van Rijsbergen 's F measure which computes an aggregate score from precision and recall :  van Rijsbergen 1979 .
4750,3,This object is able to synchronize global repair .
4751,5,Hindle 1990 proposed dealing with the sparseness problem by estimating the likelihood of unseen events from that of `` similar '' events that have been seen .
4752,3,We need strong NP-completeness of 3-Partition here _comma_ since our reduction uses a unary encoding .
4753,3,However there are some important rules of thumb : one should carefully consider the expressive capabilities required ; and a judicious commitment to simplicity and elegance will probably pay off in the long run .
4754,3,F-structures can mathematically be regarded as ( finite ) functions from a set of attributes to a set of atomic values _comma_ semantic forms and ( recursively ) f-structures .
4755,3,The implication of this equivalence is that if _comma_ say _comma_ we are translating into a  language from a head-final language and have isomorphic dominance structures between the source and target parses _comma_ then simply mirroring the source parse structure in the initial target TNCB will provide a correct initial guess .
4756,3,The value of  increases with strength of semantic relation between w and w ' .
4757,3,BKWD_CENTER : The thread currently being followed
4758,3,For instance _comma_ it is possible to analyse the input in ` layers ' of linguistic categories _comma_ perhaps starting by analysing noun-phrases _comma_ then prepositions _comma_ verbs _comma_ relative clauses _comma_ clauses _comma_ conjuncts _comma_ and finally complete sentences .
4759,4,For reasons of uncertainty of assumptions _comma_ incremental systems with this facility must be able to repair the default decision when the assumption turns out to be wrong by information given later .
4760,3,Hopefully _comma_ Assoc would have a better performance if it was estimated on a bigger population .
4761,3,The appropriate rule in CG notation would be :
4762,3,These constraints regulate the interaction of the ` mother of ' relation on  _comma_ zoomin _comma_ and specific features in .
4763,5,The representation of belief in these models has been binary ;
4764,3,The results indicate that using the GLR* parser results in a significant improvement in performance .
4765,5,Briefly _comma_ the standard view within formal semantics _comma_ which Dalrymple et al. inherit _comma_ identifies semantic interpretation with composition : interpretation is the process of taking the meanings of various constituents and composing them together to form the meaning of the whole .
4766,4,Texts `` about '' the same thing may be in differing genres _comma_ of different types _comma_ and of varying quality .
4767,6,Dynamic grammars may be extended using the following combination rule ( and and or are both given the special transition type CONJ ) : F
4768,3,On the other hand _comma_ in the editorials most of the relations between sentences are supposed to be understood semantically _comma_ and are not expressed rhetorically .
4769,3,We now turn to the second main component of LFG _comma_ the well formedness conditions on f-structures .
4770,3,Testing on a held-out sample _comma_ the similarity model achieved a 20 % reduction in perplexity for unseen bigrams .
4771,3,Firstly _comma_ it is able to capture the most important sentence-internal contextual effects regardless of the complexity of the probabilistic dependencies between the objects involved .
4772,7,Finally a partial implementation of these ideas is presented _comma_ along with some preliminary results from testing on a small set of sentences .
4773,3,A TNCB records dominance information from derivations and is amenable to incremental updates .
4774,5,An example of a dialogue that the TRAINS system can engage in is shown in Figure  .
4775,3,the hearer is confident that the identification plan is adequate .
4776,3,When f has many local optima _comma_ deterministic methods such as hill-climbing perform poorly .
4777,3,I would argue that success at that task will require combining knowledge of the kind that WordNet provides _comma_ primarily about relatedness of meaning _comma_ with knowledge of the kind best provided by corpora _comma_ primarily about usage in context .
4778,3,We have implemented only a subset of the moves that we have developed _comma_ and inspection of our results gives reason to believe that these additional moves may significantly improve the performance of our algorithm .
4779,1,For a large class of grammars in effect identical operations can be performed off-line thereby allowing for more efficient processing .
4780,3,Suppose that we have data of the type shown in Figure  _comma_ given by instances of the case frame of verb ` fly ' automatically extracted from a corpus _comma_ using conventional techniques .
4781,3,The strength of a belief P depending on a set of underlying assumptions  is MIN ( Strength ( ) ) .
4782,3,The method is illustrated primarily by example _comma_ though results of a more rigorous evaluation are also presented .
4783,4,Motion verbs can be used directly with a location _comma_ when they are transitive ( to cross the town ) or with a spatial preposition _comma_ when they are intransitive ( to go through the town ) .
4784,3,In short _comma_ constraining equations are essentially a global check on completed structures which require the presence of certain feature values .
4785,3,The weights used in this scheme are adjustable _comma_ and can be optimized for a particular domain and / or grammar .
4786,4,In speech recognition and understanding systems _comma_ many kinds of language model may be used to choose between the word and sentence hypotheses for which there is evidence in the acoustic data .
4787,3,We discuss how well this method categorizes a set text _comma_ given a set of categories _comma_ and given a set of parameters .
4788,3,The last DAG in Fig.  represents that the verb ` yomu ( read ) ' requires two roles ` the reader ' and ` the object to be read ' _comma_ and one optional role ` the counter-agent ' who hears what the reader reads .
4789,3,For N-rule modeling _comma_ clustering increases the success rate for both N = 1 and N = 2 _comma_ although only by about half as much as for N-grams .
4790,5,Incremental interpretation allows on-line semantic filtering _comma_ i.e. parses of initial fragments which have an implausible or anomalous interpretation are rejected _comma_ thereby preventing ambiguities from multiplying as the parse proceeds .
4791,4,A common mistake is to place the cursor one extra position to the left when entering diacritics .
4792,3,The rhetorical relation of a sentence _comma_ which is the relationship to the preceding part of the text _comma_ can be extracted in accordance with the connective expression in the sentence .
4793,3,The task of unknown word guessing is _comma_ however _comma_ a subtask of the overall part-of-speech tagging process .
4794,2,However _comma_ her model focuses on determining when to include informationally redundant utterances _comma_ whereas our model determines whether or not justification is needed for a claim to be convincing and _comma_ if so _comma_ selects appropriate evidence from the system 's private beliefs to support the claim .
4795,3,Heuristics for deciding how to use re-estimation in an effective manner are given .
4796,2,So the isogloss is incomplete and cannot be meaningfully compared with isoglosses based on different sets of sites .
4797,3,Lemma 14 .
4798,3,It then described the series of steps required in mapping from initial fragments of sentences to propositions which can be judged for plausibility .
4799,3,Therefore _comma_ we have  _comma_ where s is any tone and t is H or L .
4800,5,A strict top-down evaluation strategy suffers from what may be called head-recursion _comma_ i.e. the generation analog of left recursion in parsing .
4801,2,Although Gorrell proposes a general principle to guide initial attachment decisions ( Simplicity : No vacuous structure building ) _comma_ and specifies the conditions under which `` unconscious reanalysis '' may occur _comma_ the model leaves unspecified the problem of how the system may be implemented .
4802,6,Following recent work by Liberman and others _comma_ I provide a parametrised F prediction function which generates F values from a tone sequence _comma_ and I explore the asymptotic behaviour of downstep .
4803,5,In particular _comma_ we follow standard practice Jelinek and Mercer 1980 _comma_ Bahl et al. 1983 _comma_ Brown et al. 1992 and take the smoothed i-gram probability to be a linear combination of the i-gram frequency in the training data and the smoothed ( i - 1 ) - gram probability _comma_ that is _comma_
4804,3,I would like to thank Gosse Bouma _comma_ Mark-Jan Nederhof and John Nerbonne for comments on this paper .
4805,4,Similarly _comma_ each of the initial substrings can be used as a conjunct e.g .
4806,5,The context of a discourse is an undifferentiated set of propositions with no specific relations between them .
4807,3,The homogeneity becomes especially helpful in the case where the input verifies the default assumption rendering unnecessary any recomputation .
4808,3,The third column show the `` correct '' tag _comma_ as chosen by the human tagger .
4809,3,The accuracy of the recovery in our robust parser is about 68 % - 77 % .
4810,3,Rhetorical relation extraction detects rhetorical relations and constructs the sequence of sentence identifiers and relations .
4811,3,In any case _comma_ the speaker constructs an expansion that will make the plan adequate according to her beliefs .
4812,3,The perfect is seen in Kamp and Reyle 1993 as an aspectual operator .
4813,3,Accordingly _comma_ the structure can be reduced further and the length of the abstract gets shorter _comma_ without omitting key sentences .
4814,3,Both participants here believe at the outset that the expert has sufficient information about the situation and complete and correct knowledge about how to execute the Task .
4815,6,This work illustrates that existing decision-tree technology can be used to construct and estimate models which selectively choose elements of the context which contribute to disambiguation decisions _comma_ and which have few enough parameters to be trained using existing resources .
4816,3,We use features of both the candidate parse and the ignored parts of the original input sentence .
4817,3,The test set _comma_ chosen at random _comma_ contained 125 test cases .
4818,3,Combining the different n-grams by means of smoothing techniques .
4819,3,This is reflected _comma_ in our case _comma_ in the derivation of the threshold  .
4820,3,Now _comma_ let us recapitulate what has occurred in the membrane  .
4821,3,Moves of the Turing Machine can be simulated by unary productions .
4822,3,schemata-based operators encoding complex schemata for the presentation of proofs of a specific pattern ( twelve of them are currently integrated in PROVERB ) _comma_
4823,3,We associate probabilities with feature structures _comma_ which are sets of maximal and non-maximal nodes generated by beginning from the starting node and successively expanding non-maximal leaves of the partial tree .
4824,2,There is however no firm agreement on just how to compute the distance matrices .
4825,5,are to be compared Hindle and Rooth 1991 .
4826,5,For Frege 1892 _comma_ Russell 1905 _comma_ and Quine 1949 `` everything exists '' ; therefore _comma_ in their logical systems _comma_ it is impossible to formalize the cancellation of the presupposition that definite referents exist Hirst 1991 _comma_ Marcu and Hirst 1994 .
4827,2,Intuitively _comma_ such usage is infelicitous because of a dependency on a contextually salient time which has not been previously introduced .
4828,5,The strength of associativity is calculated on the basis of occurrence frequencies of word collocations in a corpus .
4829,3,This allows a natural and elegant implementation of the grammatical theory _comma_ with only one lexical entry for and .
4830,3,The members of classes 29 and 111 function as subjects .
4831,5,To be co-operative _comma_ an agent must always be participating in one of these games .
4832,4,These symbolic and statistical approaches are beginning to draw together as it becomes clear that one cannot exist entirely without the other : the knowledge of language posited over the years by theoretical linguists has been useful in constraining and guiding statistical approaches _comma_ and the corpora now available to linguists have resurrected the desire to account for real language data in a more principled way than had previously been attempted .
4833,3,The latter _comma_ however _comma_ greatly hinders the recognition of proper nouns _comma_ the most common type of error _comma_ responsible for approximately  of the model 's mistakes .
4834,3,For Swedish _comma_ 96 % of the unknown words came from inflected classes _comma_ and had a single tag ; for French the figure was about 60 % .
4835,3,Agglutinative languages could be handled efficiently by the current mechanism if specifications were provided for the affix combinations that were likely to occur at all often in real texts .
4836,3,Thus the following FSA _comma_ defining the regular language  ( i.e. an even number of a 's followed by at least one b ) is given as :
4837,3,We use a set of rules that encode discourse conventions .
4838,3,Ideally _comma_ the initiator should construct referring expressions with the recipients ' ( believed ) beliefs about salience in mind _comma_ but we have chosen to avoid this complexity by making the simplifying assumption that the initiator is an expert ( and thus knows best what is salient ) .
4839,3,This local threshold value overrules the global threshold .
4840,3,Our approach avoids both problems .
4841,7,Here we illustrate this process _comma_ and indicate what further use might be made of the information thus obtained .
4842,3,The monotonicity constraints _comma_ on the other hand _comma_ might constitute a dilution of the Shake-and-Bake ideal of independent grammars .
4843,2,This scheme fails for cases like `` The soldiers rarely come home '' vs. `` The soldiers will come home '' where the context is identical and information about the lexical item in question ( `` rarely '' vs. `` will '' ) is needed in combination with context for correct classification .
4844,3,The transition on encountering John is deterministic : State-Application cannot apply _comma_ and State-Prediction can only be instantiated one way .
4845,3,In general _comma_ we have the following mapping between transcriptions under the two views of downstep :
4846,3,First _comma_  associates atoms only with final nodes of f-structures ; and as is a function _comma_ the atom so associated is unique .
4847,3,However _comma_ looking more carefully _comma_ we find that the constraints of subordinate clause and the constraints of main clause are represented as local constraints by introducing the new notion of motivated which is characterized as a person who has enough reason to act as the main clause describes .
4848,3,We ran discriminant analysis on the texts in the corpus using several different features as seen in table  .
4849,3,The DAG in Fig.  requires a sentential form ( category S ) as an argument _comma_ and in addition _comma_ it subcategorizes an item of category N as an agent of the subsentence .
4850,3,The tediousness is largely ascribed to the lack of plan level knowledge of the input proofs _comma_ which distinguishes crucial steps from unimportant details .
4851,3,For reasons of homogeneity we use the information stored in the syntactic knowledge sources of VM-GEN for expressing syntactic constraints during default handling as well .
4852,3,In probabilistic terms _comma_ a finite-state grammar corresponds to a first-order Markov process _comma_ where given a sequence of states  _comma_ _comma_ ... drawn from a finite set of possible states { _comma_ ... _comma_ } the probability of a particular state occurring depends solely on the identity of the previous state .
4853,5,A grammar may be inferred from positive examples alone for certain subsets of regular languages Garcia and Vidal 1990 _comma_ or an inference process may degenerate into a look up procedure if every possible positive example is stored .
4854,3,A second response is to admit that there is a dynamic residue _comma_ but to deal with it in overtly computational terms .
4855,5,The project at present studies texts which appear on several different types of USENET News conferences _comma_ and investigates how well the classification criteria and categories that experienced USENET News users report using IntFilter 1993 can be used by a newsreader system .
4856,4,Notice that this natural-deduction-style proof in the type logic corresponds very closely to the phrase-structure tree one would like to adopt in an analysis with traces .
4857,3,We expect to interpret relative clauses ( uncontroversially ) and phrases with focussed constituents ( more controversially ) as abstractions over the interpretations of simple sentences .
4858,5,Previous spelling programs _comma_ unless restricted to a very small set of words _comma_ have operated as post-processors .
4859,5,It was posited that VP-ellipsis could access either propositional or discourse model representations : in the case of parallel constructions _comma_ the source resided in the propositional representation ; in the case of non-parallel constructions _comma_ the source had been integrated into the discourse model .
4860,3,`` Implicit '' is a stylistic feature value _comma_ indicating that the splitting of the proof into the three subgoals is not made explicit .
4861,3,Finally _comma_ to demonstrate the type of proofs currently generated by PROVERB _comma_ below is the complete output for a proof constructed by  - MKRP :
4862,3,Let F be a group and U a subgroup of F _comma_ if 1 and  are unit elements of F and U respectively _comma_ then .
4863,5,Viewing the input for parsing as a FSA rather than as a string combines well with some approaches in speech understanding systems _comma_ in which parsing takes a word lattice as input ( rather than a word string ) .
4864,2,However _comma_ to date there has been little success in constructing grammar-based language models competitive with n-gram models in problems of any magnitude .
4865,3,Abstract generation based on rhetorical structure extraction has four merits .
4866,3,incorporate other syntactic information _comma_ such as affixes knowledge
4867,3,We then used a set of 120 new sentences as a test set .
4868,7,Below follow an outline and discussion of the ( linguistic ) components of PET and discussion of testing and evaluation of the system .
4869,4,save the cost of constructing a thesaurus by hand _comma_
4870,3,It will assign a value close to 1.0 if two words share many neighbors _comma_ and 0.0 if they share none .
4871,5,Haddock 1987 uses incremental refinement of sets of possible referents .
4872,3,The rules are accepted / rejected by checking that the lexical string ( s ) can extend along the lexical tree ( s ) from the current position ( s ) .
4873,3,Clearly _comma_ this construct is closely related to the Kasper Rounds path equality Kasper and Rounds 1990 ; the principle difference is that whereas the Kasper Rounds enforces path equalities within the domain of feature structures _comma_ the LFG path equality enforces equalities between the tree domain and the feature structure domain .
4874,3,The assumptions are given with the inference rule below .
4875,3,Our experimental results indicate that for certain classes of verbs _comma_ the accuracy achieved in a disambiguation experiment is improved by using the acquired knowledge of dependencies .
4876,1,The model presented corrects errors resulting from combining nonconcatenative strings as well as more standard morphological or spelling errors .
4877,5,Primarily _comma_ two sources have been examined : prosody and word stress .
4878,1,The first deals with distance matrices .
4879,5,DOP attempts to combine these two traditions and produce `` performance grammars '' _comma_ which :
4880,1,whether the form is anaphoric in the semantics .
4881,3,We define a module named default handler which tries to resume the process by giving advice to it _comma_ i.e. _comma_ by making assumptions about the missing input specification .
4882,3,Semantic classes are represented extensionally as sets of nouns .
4883,3,For example _comma_ a state can elaborate another state or an event :
4884,7,We now return to consider cases involving intensional verbs .
4885,3,Suppose further that this rule is now applied to the corpus _comma_ and then the rule is applied again but with a local threshold level of 1 .
4886,3,After all _comma_ both LFG and GPSG drew on ( and developed ) a heterogeneous collection of traditional grammar specification tools _comma_ such as context free rules _comma_ equations _comma_ and features .
4887,3,The leftmost literal in the body of a non-unit clause is always the selected literal .
4888,7,We review the standard probabilistic interpretation of PCFGs .
4889,6,We present a different method that takes as starting point the back-off scheme of Katz 1987 .
4890,3,is assigned a specific probability by a slot-based model .
4891,3,The acquired guessing rules employed in our cascading guesser are _comma_ in fact _comma_ of a standard nature and in that form or another are used in other POS - guessers .
4892,4,The meaning language could be that of any appropriate logic ; for present purposes _comma_ higher-order logic will suffice .
4893,3,Other cases of context dependence modeled by a knowledge source can be handled similarly .
4894,3,modal operators for talking about feature structures _comma_ and
4895,2,The third problem is that most languages have dialect continua _comma_ such that the speech of one community differs little from the speech of its neighbours .
4896,3,models capture the essence of LFG ontology _comma_ and _comma_
4897,5,For example _comma_ a parse of the sentence John likes Mary becomes a mapping between an initial state _comma_ c  _comma_ through some intermediate states _comma_ c _comma_ c to a final state c i.e. c  c  c  c If we use a dynamic grammar to describe a shift reduce parser _comma_ states encode the current stack configuration _comma_ and are related by rules which correspond to shifting and reducing .
4898,3,The fact that different IRU 's address different assumptions leads to the perception that some IRU 's are better evidence for understanding than others _comma_ e.g. a PARAPHRASE is stronger evidence of understanding than a REPEAT Clark and Schaefer 1989 .
4899,3,The correct parses of 250 grammatical sentences were used to train the parse table statistics that are used for disambiguation and parse evaluation .
4900,1,We conducted an empirical analysis into the relation between control and discourse structure .
4901,3,can take account compositional distinctions that do not result in meaning differences _comma_ and also
4902,5,Here we want to reintroduce some worlds _comma_ those in which neither Mary or John left .
4903,4,From a purely strategic point of view _comma_ the agent may have no interest in whether the stranger 's goals are met .
4904,3,PCAs can be viewed as speech acts in our domain of application .
4905,3,It is perhaps worth adding that at present the authors simply do not know what the best response is .
4906,3,While such complex intention recognition may be required in some complex interactions _comma_ it is not needed to handle the typical interactions of everyday discourse .
4907,7,We begin by describing how constraints inherent in LIG admit tractable processing algorithms and then consider how these constraints can be generalized to a formalism that manipulates trees rather than stacks .
4908,3,When we travel or run _comma_ we go from some part to another part of a same global location .
4909,5,Typically _comma_ the adjustment involves either interpolation _comma_ in which the new estimator is a weighted combination of the MLE and an estimator that is guaranteed to be nonzero for unseen bigrams _comma_ or discounting _comma_ in which the MLE is decreased according to a model of the unreliability of small frequency counts _comma_ leaving some probability mass for unseen bigrams .
4910,3,There are often situations where the criteria to guide the search are available only for the base cases _comma_ for example
4911,5,For example _comma_ when processing  _comma_ rule would be used with :
4912,6,In some respects it is an extension of some of their suggestions .
4913,3,We can write the following formula _comma_ where  if and if .
4914,3,induction based on word type only
4915,3,Feature constraints _comma_ and cases where the rules will not apply if those constraints are broken _comma_ are shown .
4916,5,The various formulations of this ` no redundancy ' rule permeate many computational analyses of natural language and notions of cooperativity .
4917,2,Yet _comma_ n-gram language models can only capture dependencies within an n-word window _comma_ where currently the largest practical n for natural language is three _comma_ and many dependencies in natural language occur beyond a three-word window .
4918,3,To decide how to evaluate UNDERSPECIFICATIONS and the contribution of ASSUMPTIONS _comma_ and
4919,3,There are _comma_ however _comma_ a few points which make the rule-sets acquired by the presented here technique more accurate :
4920,5,`` Data Oriented Parsing ( DOP ) is a model where no abstract rules _comma_ but language experiences in the form of an analyzed corpus _comma_ constitute the basis for language processing . ''
4921,3,Here we will work upto the rules gradually _comma_ by considering which kinds of rules we might need in particular instances .
4922,1,We have developed an automatic abstract generation system for Japanese expository writings based on rhetorical structure extraction .
4923,3,Analyzing the results obtained from the testing sample ( some of which are shown in tables  and ) we draw some positive ( _comma_ ) and some negative conclusions ( _comma_ _comma_ and ) :
4924,3,In the end it may turn out there is simply no way of making the prediction without a source of information extrinsic to both model and corpus .
4925,1,This article proposes a method for automatically finding the appropriate tree-cutting criteria in the EBG scheme _comma_ rather than having to hand-code them .
4926,5,In this case the threading through semantic structure is in the opposite order to the order in which the two clauses appear in the sentence .
4927,3,The authors would like to thank Nirit Kadmon and Uwe Reyle for reading a preliminary version of this paper .
4928,3,The developed off-line compilation techniques make crucial use of the fundamental properties of the HPSG formalism .
4929,3,To put in another way _comma_ in what medium should we specify grammars .
4930,3,As discussed in Section  _comma_ we expect the number of affix combinations to be limited _comma_ but the lexicon is not necessarily known in advance .
4931,3,In other words _comma_ strategies are cooperative for certain conversational partners _comma_ under particular task definitions _comma_ for particular communication situations .
4932,5,Bernard Lang defines parsing as the calculation of the intersection of a FSA ( the input ) and a CFG .
4933,5,Most current NL text planners assume that language generation is planned behavior and therefore adopt a hierarchical planning approach Hovy 1988 _comma_ Moore 1989 _comma_ Dale 1992 _comma_ Reithinger 1991 .
4934,3,_comma_ were missing in the small lexicon .
4935,3,Therefore to determine countability and generate number we need to use a combination of information from the Japanese original sentence _comma_ and default information from the Japanese to English transfer dictionary .
4936,5,One subject was required to get the other subject to rearrange his set to match the ordering of her set _comma_ and to do so through conversation alone .
4937,5,These transitions describe how utterances are linked together in a coherent local segment of discourse .
4938,3,It is also partly due to the fixed lexicon choice _comma_ which we are currently reimplementing .
4939,5,The other tagger was the rule-based tagger of Brill 1995 .
4940,3,GeLD ( Generalized Linguistic Deduction ) is an extension of Prolog which provides typed feature descriptions and preference values as additions to the expressivity of the language _comma_ and partial evaluation _comma_ top-down _comma_ head-driven _comma_ and bottom-up Earley deduction as processing strategies .
4941,3,is a total function from Q to _comma_ and
4942,3,A number of built-in predicates are provided which allow the user to constrain the behaviour of the parser in various ways _comma_ based on the notions of coverage _comma_ span and threshold :
4943,3,For example _comma_ we can use a single entry in the recognition array to store the fact that all of the feature structures that can appear at the root of the trees in Figure  derive the substring .
4944,3,Continuing with the example _comma_ if the hearer were not confident about the adequacy of the funny-looking building _comma_ he might suggest that the initiator use height ( as well as architectural style ) _comma_ by asking Is it tall ?
4945,3,As this example illustrates _comma_ tense and aspect on ellipsis and antecedent do not have to agree .
4946,3,On the other hand _comma_ how many of the noun occurrences in the testing sample have the correct sense introduced in the taxonomy : 2_comma_165 of the 2_comma_372 well-extracted triples ( 92.3 % ) .
4947,3,Add a new link l ' to rfr of  _comma_ where l ' is a link to with thickness .
4948,5,This is due to the fact that composition can be used to form a function _comma_ which can then be used as an argument to a function of a function .
4949,4,They are too complex morphologically to yield easily to the simpler techniques that can work for English .
4950,3,Parentheses may be used to resolve ambiguities .
4951,3,Context-dependence may enter either at the interpretive mapping from sentence to meaning and / or the evaluative mapping from meaning ( and the world ) to truth-values .
4952,5,The result of both plans is the surface speech action s-actions .
4953,2,The strong substructure condition means that the algorithm will be incomplete for grammars which cover semantically void phrases like expletive expressions _comma_ particles _comma_ and subphrases of idioms .
4954,3,Abdications and summaries are devices which allow these contributions to be coordinated and participants use these devices to explicitly set up opportunities for one another to make a contribution _comma_ and to ensure mutual beliefs .
4955,3,To illustrate _comma_ the English analysis module might analyse  as .
4956,3,However _comma_ we do not impose this restriction because it still leaves open the possibility of generating trees in which every branch has the same length _comma_ thus violating the condition that trees have at most a bounded number of unbounded _comma_ dependent branches .
4957,1,We have shown how higher-order logic programming can be used to elegantly implement the semantic theory of CCG _comma_ including the previously difficult case of its handling of coordination constructs .
4958,2,This observation is not very helpful in establishing insights concerning interesting subclasses of DCGs for which termination can be guaranteed ( in the case of FSA input ) .
4959,3,We assume that a speech recognition subsystem delivers a list of text strings corresponding to transcriptions of an input utterance .
4960,3,Thus the pair `` most < adjective > '' is taken as a single superlative adjective .
4961,3,Basically _comma_ the processing-conforming mode makes the overall system homogeneous because the combination of default-caused processing and input-licensed processing requires no specific description .
4962,3,where the iterations are over each utterance  in the corpus _comma_ each cluster from which might arise _comma_ and each word in utterance .
4963,3,The proposed method of computational dialogue simulation provides a new empirical basis for computational linguistics .
4964,3,the state of world ;
4965,2,The resulting system is sufficiently restricted in cases where other approaches overgenerate ; the very property of resource-sensitivity for which resource sharing appears to be problematic actually provides explanatory advantages over systems that more freely replicate resources during derivation .
4966,3,Note also that the above table is dependent upon how the data in  was transcribed .
4967,3,Given the high frequency of occurrence of noun compounds in many texts _comma_ this suggests that the use of these techniques in probabilistic parsers will result in higher performance in broad coverage natural language processing .
4968,3,meaning that when cher is an adjp ( adjective ) it may combine with the suffixes listed to produce the inflected forms shown .
4969,4,Unfortunately _comma_ the expressivity of these formalisms can have undesirable consequences for their processing .
4970,3,The test data for this experiment were pruned word lattices for 403 WSJ closed-vocabulary test sentences .
4971,3,The developed techniques are extensively tested with a large HPSG grammar for partial VP topicalization in German Hinrichs et al. 1994 .
4972,6,For the implementation we extended the HPSG grammar Pollard and Sag 1994 which Gerald Penn and Bob Carpenter first encoded in ALE Carpenter 1993 .
4973,4,In training a tagger for a given language _comma_ a major part of the knowledge engineering required can therefore be localised in the choice of the tagset .
4974,5,Both the EAA and the DIA were presented as approaches to the inversion of parser-oriented grammars into grammars suitable for generation .
4975,7,In this section _comma_ I show how it is possible to get two programs to produce a sequence of tones T ( i.e. a tone transcription ) given a sequence of n F  values X .
4976,3,Development _comma_ compilation and run-time efficiency are quite acceptable _comma_ and the use of rules containing complex feature-augmented categories allows morphotactic behaviours and non-segmental spelling constraints to be specified in a way that is perspicuous to linguists _comma_ leading to rapid development of descriptions adequate for full NLP .
4977,3,Finally _comma_ we note that acyclic feature structures without re-entrancy can be viewed as trees with branches labelled by feature names and atomic values only found at leaf nodes ( interior nodes being unlabelled ) .
4978,3,The paper then considered various processing accounts _comma_ where the syntactic context is encoded within the state of the parser .
4979,3,For the test _comma_ four corpora were constructed from the LOB corpus : LOB-B from part B _comma_ LOB-L from part L _comma_ LOB-B-G from parts B to G inclusive and LOB-B-J from parts B to J inclusive .
4980,3,To put a perspective on that aspect we measure the overall tagging performance :
4981,3,Therefore _comma_ to the extent that Figure  is typical of tone languages in having different H and L asymptotes _comma_ one must conclude that total and partial downstep are qualitative terms only .
4982,3,This factor is manifested in tone transitions according to the following pattern :
4983,3,We call these verbs change of position ( CoPs ) verbs .
4984,5,A sentence such as the following has 4862 different syntactic parses due solely to attachment ambiguity Stabler 1991 .
4985,3,In semidirectional Lambek calculus SDL there is an additional non-directional abstraction rule allowing the formula abstracted over to appear anywhere in the premise sequent 's left-hand side _comma_ thus permitting non-peripheral extraction .
4986,5,The CCG rules  shown in Figure are implemented in the system described in this paper .
4987,3,For example _comma_ in sentence [ CREF] above strings  _comma_ and [ CREF] can never be correct .
4988,5,In CGs which contain functions of functions ( such as very _comma_ or slowly ) _comma_ the addition of composition adds both new analyses of sentences _comma_ and new strings to the language .
4989,5,But since stack length is at least proportional to the length of the input string _comma_ the resultant algorithm would exhibit exponential space and time complexity in the worst case .
4990,7,In the final section we summarize the main results of the paper .
4991,2,Firstly _comma_ for sentence processing using a serial architecture ( rather than one in which syntactic and semantic processing is performed in parallel ) _comma_ the savings in computation obtained from on-line filtering have to be balanced against the additional costs of performing semantic computations for parses of fragments which would eventually be ruled out anyway from purely syntactic considerations .
4992,3,Proposition 26 .
4993,4,However _comma_ 3 to 5 % of word tokens are usually missing in the lexicon when tagging real-world texts .
4994,3,Our experiments with the lexicon and word frequencies derived from the Brown Corpus _comma_ which can be considered as a general model of English _comma_ resulted in guessing rule-sets which proved to be domain and corpus independent _comma_ producing similar results on test texts of different origin .
4995,7,Before describing the implementation of coordination _comma_ it is first necessary to mention how CCG categories are represented in the  -Prolog code .
4996,5,In these experiments the scheme was applied to the grammar of a version of the SRI Core Language Engine Alshawi 1992 adapted to the ATIS domain for a speech-translation task Rayner et al. 1993 and large corpora of real user data collected using Wizard-of-Oz simulation .
4997,5,But Kaufman and Rousseeuw 1990 suggest that when the emphasis in a clustering problem is on the top-level clusters -- here _comma_ finding the two main dialects -- then such bottom-up methods _comma_ which can potentially introduce error at each of several steps _comma_ are less reliable than top-down partitioning methods .
4998,3,We first examined the last utterance of each phase on the grounds that one mechanism for indicating the end of a phase would be for the speaker controlling the phase to give some cue that he ( both participants in the dialogues were always male ) no longer wished to control the discourse .
4999,3,Our compiler uses the type hierarchy to determine paths with a value of a minimal type without appropriate features as bound .
5000,5,Context Karttunen 1974 _comma_ Kay 1992 _comma_ procedural rules Gazdar 1979 _comma_ Karttunen and Peters 1979 _comma_ lexical and syntactic structure Weischedel 1979 _comma_ intentions Hirschberg 1985 _comma_ or anaphoric constraints Sandt 1992 _comma_ Zeevat 1992 decide what presuppositions or implicatures are projected as pragmatic inferences for the utterance that is analyzed .
5001,5,The principles and parameters paradigm in linguistics is most fully realised in the Government-Binding Theory ( GB ) of Chomsky 1981 _comma_ Chomsky 1986 and others .
5002,3,The reason for this is that we would ideally like to assign probabilities to intermediate structures in such a way that the probabilities of fully expanded structures are independent of the route by which they were arrived at .
5003,3,We empirically evaluated the effectiveness of our method .
5004,1,This paper presents a treatment of ellipsis which avoids these difficulties _comma_ while having essentially the same coverage as Dalrymple et al. .
5005,3,Neither of these is crucial to the remainder of the paper _comma_ but if you don't like them you will have to replace them with something better _comma_ and you are unlikely to find something which is both better and simpler .
5006,3,Almost one correct semantic class for each syntactic position in the sample is acquired .
5007,7,The selection of clauses is guided by a scanning step ( section  ) and indexing of clauses ( section ) .
5008,3,The evaluation described below was performed on the largest data set we have worked with so far _comma_ extracted from 44 million words of 1988 Associated Press newswire with the pattern matching techniques mentioned earlier .
5009,3,The method relays in the use of a wide-coverage noun taxonomy and a statistical measure of the co-occurrence of linguistic items .
5010,3,All of these facts are explained by the account given here .
5011,2,The smallest constituent containing to study medicine when he was eleven is the verb phase wanted to study medicine when he was eleven .
5012,3,In order to experiment the methodology presented _comma_ we implemented a system in a Unix machine .
5013,3,For the sentence ` a a b b ' we obtain the parse forest grammar :
5014,3,Given that upstep and downstep are intended as inverses of each other _comma_ we have the identities  _comma_ with s _comma_ t as before .
5015,7,We will discuss this work below .
5016,3,Developers may wish to add and test further lexical entries without frequently recompiling the rules _comma_ and it may also be necessary to deal with unknown words at run time _comma_ for example by querying a large external lexical database or attempting spelling correction Alshawi 1992 .
5017,3,In addition _comma_ we argue that various linguistic devices are necessary for conversational participants to coordinate their contributions to the dialogue and agree on their mutual beliefs with respect to a evolving plan _comma_ for example _comma_ to agree that a particular subgoal has been achieved .
5018,3,Since the temporal connective in this sentence is before _comma_ the relation between these two markers is one of precedence .
5019,3,This text was detected to have 347 unknown words .
5020,3,We refer to a member of the Cartesian product of a noun partition and a verb partition (  ) simply as a ` cluster ' .
5021,4,A speech translation system _comma_ which by necessity combines speech and language technology _comma_ is a natural place to consider combining the statistical and conventional approaches and much of this paper describes probabilistic models of structural language analysis and translation .
5022,1,We have described the tagset _comma_ lexicon and guesser that we built for our French tagger .
5023,5,Partee 1973 introduced the notion of temporal anaphora _comma_ to account for ways in which temporal expressions depend on surrounding elements in the discourse for their semantic contribution to the discourse .
5024,3,TEMP_CENTER : Used for temporal centering ; Keeps track of the thread currently being followed ( since there is a preference for continuing the current thread ) and all the threads that have been constructed so far in the discourse .
5025,3,For instance danses is associated with the ambiguity class [ + NOUN-PL + VERB-P 1 P 2 ] _comma_ i.e. it is either a plural noun or a verb form that belongs to the collapsed first or second person paradigm .
5026,3,The effects of the four most common types on the five major noun countability preferences are shown in Table  .
5027,3,The indefinite main verb tense is then ordered with respect to this  .
5028,3,Further _comma_ the paths between f-structures are made available in the semantic space as resources .
5029,4,This results in the vowels being shifted one position _comma_ e.g. *  wkatubi instead of wakutib .
5030,3,As mentioned before _comma_ with each new symbol A we also create a rule  .
5031,5,Shake-and-Bake translation assumes a source grammar _comma_ a target grammar and a bilingual dictionary which relates translationally equivalent sets of lexical signs _comma_ carrying across the semantic dependencies established by the source language analysis stage into the target language generation stage .
5032,4,Orthographically _comma_ Semitic texts appear in three forms :
5033,3,The central difficulty is finding a representative sample of genuine errors by native speakers _comma_ in context _comma_ with the correct version of the text attached .
5034,3,These new properties are only the result of the interaction of the verb with the preposition .
5035,3,Strict adjacency between RHS clauses can be specified in the grammar .
5036,3,We assume that a structure of a compound noun can be expressed by a binary tree .
5037,3,Although the choice of language was dictated by the corpora which were available _comma_ they represent three different degrees of complexity in their inflectional systems .
5038,3,The maximal degree of nondeterminacy introduced by a right-hand side category equals the maximal number of rules and / or lexical entries with which this category unifies given its binding annotations .
5039,5,An agent has certain goals _comma_ and communication results from a planning process to achieve these goals .
5040,6,The crucial aspect for this paper is that together these features permits the usage of abstract syntax to express the logical forms terms computed by CCG .
5041,4,One example is
5042,5,resulting in the sentence :
5043,3,For example _comma_ in a variant of the English tagger which was not used in these experiments _comma_ a module which reduces the range of possible tags based on testing for only seven surface characteristics such as capitalisation and word endings improved the unknown word accuracy by 15 - 20 .
5044,5,Methods for the automatic compilation of rules from a notation convenient for the rule-writer into finite-state automata have also been developed _comma_ allowing the efficient analysis and synthesis of word forms .
5045,3,for each  _comma_ each and each _comma_ if is defined and then is defined _comma_ and
5046,1,This experiment shows that an automatic procedure can reliably group a language into its dialect areas _comma_ starting from nothing more than phonetic transcriptions as commonly found in linguistic surveys .
5047,3,This is a deliberately naive approach _comma_ and it is adopted with the goal of continuing in the relatively `` knowledge-free '' tradition of work in HMM tagging .
5048,3,Entries in this element of the recognition array that are compatible ( i.e. unifiable ) with the bounded _comma_ local information correspond to different possible values for the feature .
5049,3,For example _comma_ `` ties '' is used as a verb only 2 times ( out of 15 occurrences in the corpus ) .
5050,3,two possibilities _comma_
5051,3,Finally _comma_ our account readily applies to cases of intensional verbs without coordination as in example  _comma_ since it applies more generally to cases of resource sharing .
5052,3,If a hand-tagged training corpus is available _comma_ use it .
5053,3,First _comma_ we tagged the text by the four different combinations of the taggers with the word-guessers using the full-fledged lexicon .
5054,3,The more that context-dependence enters into the interpretive mapping ( so that meanings are correspondingly more context-independent ) _comma_ the harder it is to maintain a principle of strict compositionality in interpretation .
5055,6,While our work is in part motivated by the above research _comma_ other developmental research supports certain assumptions we make .
5056,3,We could expect to achieve D1 from _comma_ say _comma_ a printed dictionary listing parts of speech in order of frequency .
5057,3,describes a simple tense event _comma_ or
5058,3,Obviously it would be instructive to conduct a similar analysis on other textual types .
5059,3,We also found that child-directed speech was much easier to segment than adult-directed speech when using both sources .
5060,3,CUE_WORD : Cues to rhetorical structure _comma_ e.g. _comma_ `` because . ''
5061,5,Elsie 1986 considers a dialect to be an area where all communities are linguistically more similar to each other than any community is to any site outside the dialect .
5062,3,where  is the occurrence density of word X in a whole corpus _comma_ and the conditional probability is the density of X in a neighborhood of word Y. Here the neighborhood is defined as 50 words before or after any appearance of word Y .
5063,5,This approach entails however that a corpus has first to be pre-analyzed ( ie. hand-parsed ) _comma_ and the question immediately arises as to the formalism to be used for this .
5064,3,They will both have the category  .
5065,3,The speaker can
5066,3,Figure  shows two example models which might have given rise to the data in Figure .
5067,3,F  Scaling
5068,3,to CENTER a proposition _comma_ ie. make or keep a proposition salient Grosz et al. 1986 .
5069,3,This hypothesis has been broadly adopted in the work of van Oirsouw 1987 _comma_ Barry and Pickering 1993 _comma_ and by work on the Lambek Calculus Moortgat 1988 .
5070,3,Performance was measured as the percent of mismatches between the output generated by the HMM and the tags assigned by manual tagging .
5071,3,This enables us to measure the similarity between texts as a syntactic process _comma_ not as word lists .
5072,3,In the second column _comma_ the number following the slash indicates the number of elements in the equivalence class from which the model had to choose .
5073,3,u is an object in I _comma_
5074,3,Of course simply knowing the dialect areas is not the last word in dialectology .
5075,3,Let 's first consider how to write specifications which capture the effect of schemata annotated grammar rules .
5076,2,First _comma_ it no longer needs to be posited that syntactic representations disappear when integrated into the discourse model ; instead _comma_ syntactic and semantic representations co-exist .
5077,3,D1 Lexical probabilities are correctly ordered _comma_ so that the most frequent tag has the highest lexical probability and so on _comma_ but the absolute values are otherwise unreliable .
5078,3,If we put the focus somewhere else _comma_ we get another interpretation :
5079,5,The results of the Xerox experiment appear very encouraging .
5080,4,Supposedly agent A should omit a warrant is if it is already believed by B _comma_ so that the speaker in  would not have said It 's shorter if she believed that the hearer knew that the Walnut St. route was shorter .
5081,5,The first is to introduce an explicit product operator Wood 1988 _comma_ allowing types of the form NP * NP .
5082,4,As was pointed out above _comma_ one of the requirements in many techniques for automatic learning of part-of-speech guessing rules is specially prepared training data -- a pre-tagged training corpus _comma_ training examples _comma_ etc .
5083,3,We can benefit in two ways from performing such evaluations :
5084,3,First _comma_ we define a noun partition  over a given set of nouns and a verb partion over a given set of verbs .
5085,4,Texts vary along several parameters _comma_ all relevant for the general information retrieval problem of matching reader needs and texts .
5086,3,In fact _comma_ the factors making motherese more learnable might be elucidated using this technique : compare the results of several different models _comma_ each containing a different factor or combination of factors _comma_ looking for those in which a substantial performance difference exists between child - and adult-directed speech .
5087,3,The last argument will result from the coordination of the second and third arguments .
5088,3,This in turn requires that forms like danses - and chante-t - be introduced into the new lexicon .
5089,4,Thus _comma_ when facing a conflict _comma_ a collaborative agent should not automatically reject a belief with which she does not agree ; instead _comma_ she should evaluate the belief and the evidence provided to her and adopt the belief if the evidence is convincing .
5090,1,It also offers a reasonably automatic means to gather evidence on whether a more complex _comma_ context-sensitive model using the same general kind of linguistic information is likely to reward the effort that would be required to develop it : if clustering improves the performance of a model _comma_ this proves the existence of further context dependencies _comma_ not exploited by the unclustered model .
5091,3,In  _comma_ for example _comma_ the default interpretation would be that John 's being in Detroit overlaps with his being in Boston _comma_ but the phrase the previous Thursday overrides this _comma_ giving the interpretation that John 's being in Detroit precedes his being in Boston :
5092,3,On the other hand _comma_ we define recall as the proportion of triples which fulfill one of the SRs acquired for their corresponding syntactic positions .
5093,4,In part of speech tagging by Hidden Markov Model _comma_ a statistical model is used to assign grammatical categories to words in a text .
5094,3,For example _comma_ since the right node of the serial relation ( e.g. _comma_ yotte ( thus ) ) is the conclusion of the left node _comma_ the relation is categorized into RightNucleus _comma_ and the right node is more important than the left node .
5095,3,The proposed procedure is based on successive calls to the anaphora module and to the PP attachment module .
5096,2,We compare the performance of our algorithm to n-gram models and the Inside-Outside algorithm in three language modeling tasks .
5097,5,One further possibility is to choose a single syntax tree _comma_ and to use destructive tree operations later in the parse .
5098,4,In addition _comma_ people are prone to mistakes in writing sentences .
5099,4,In example  the two prepositions are attached differently _comma_ one to the verb saw _comma_ the other to the noun _comma_ man .
5100,4,In the Japanese language _comma_ the causative and the change of voice are realized by agglutinations of those auxiliary verbs at the tail of current verbs .
5101,5,The analyses are verified in the sense that each analysis has been judged to be the preferred one for that input sentence by a human evaluator using a semi-automatic evaluation method .
5102,4,( Note that this assumption is the simplest among those that relax the independence assumption . )
5103,3,Induced tree-cutting criteria where the node entropy was the sum of the phrase entropy of the RHS phrase of the dominating grammar rule and the weighted sum of the phrase entropies of the LHSs of the alternative choices of grammar rules to resolve on .
5104,3,This method uses the information available in the original Japanese sentence along with information about English countability at both the noun phrase and noun level that can be stored in Japanese to English transfer dictionaries .
5105,3,three tree modalities  _comma_ and _comma_
5106,1,We proposed some evaluation measures for the SRs learning task .
5107,5,Most linguistic approaches account for the defeasibility of pragmatic inferences by analyzing them in a context that consists of all or some of the previous utterances _comma_ including the current one .
5108,5,Despite this fact _comma_ little work has been done so far toward employing this technology for the disambiguation of German texts Wothke et al. 1993 _comma_ Schmid and Kempe 1995 .
5109,2,Games provide a better explanation of coherence _comma_ but still require the agents to recognize each other 's intentions to perform the dialogue game .
5110,3,Here an np  s was expected _comma_ but likes only provides part of this : it requires an np to the right to form an np s .
5111,3,The results of the four experiments were evaluated by forming 16 classes of tags from the Penn Treebank as shown in Table  .
5112,3,The category constrains resolution to look for verb phrase / sentence sources _comma_ which come wrapped in with categories like
5113,5,Troll exploits this property to represent each feature structure as a finite state automaton and a set of output functions .
5114,3,and are simple constructors for implication and conjunction _comma_ to be used with forall and exists respectively _comma_ in the typical manner Pereira and Shieber 1987 .
5115,1,This paper defines a language  for specifying LFG grammars .
5116,3,Generalising our equation once more _comma_ we have the following _comma_ where R is a factor called the transition ratio .
5117,3,These two articles do not share any right neighbors since the former is only used before consonants and the latter only before vowels .
5118,3,Distance vectors are normalized by first changing each coordinate into its deviation in the coordinate :
5119,3,Then the first consequence of only says that what I did to this car was I borrowed it : substituting the description of the event type for the abstracted variable F produces  as the second argument of simple _comma_ and this reduces to _comma_ which is what we want .
5120,5,Putting these two quotes together is _comma_ however _comma_ misleading _comma_ since it suggests a more direct mapping between incremental semantics and dynamic semantics than is actually possible .
5121,5,The resource-sensitive system of linear logic is used to compute meanings in accordance with relationships manifest in LFG f-structures .
5122,3,This applies to the same attributes as the completeness principle and requires that whenever they occur in an f-structure they must also occur in the f-structure associated with its pred attribute .
5123,4,Registering all compound nouns in a dictionary is an impractical approach _comma_ since we can create a new compound noun by combining nouns .
5124,3,It goes on to investigate ways in which a corpus pre-parsed with this formalism may be processed to provide a probabilistic language model for use in the parsing of fresh texts .
5125,3,Third _comma_ the dependency relations that determine the communication links between objects allow for a hierarchical organization of the objects _comma_ which is the basis for synchronizing repair .
5126,3,Temporally _comma_ the state s starts just when e ends _comma_ or as it is put in Kamp and Reyle 1993 : e and s abut _comma_ ( represented as e s ) .
5127,4,In this case _comma_ the output has to be repaired _comma_ e.g. _comma_ by repeating parts of the utterance : `` I will be able to meet you ... oops ... I won't be able to meet you at the hotel this evening . ''
5128,3,I call each member of U an object in I .
5129,3,We used tagged Wall Street Journal text from the Penn treebank _comma_ which has a tag set size of about fifty .
5130,5,Brown et al. 1992 suggest a class-based n-gram model in which words with similar cooccurrence distributions are clustered in word classes .
5131,3,According to this scheme _comma_  is more likely to follow if it tends to follow words that are most similar to .
5132,5,Based on corpus statistics _comma_ they provide analogies between words that often agree with our linguistic and domain intuitions .
5133,5,A simple _comma_ intuitive way of measuing the size of a hypothesis is to count the number of characters used to represent it .
5134,3,Tested for french _comma_ english _comma_ spanish and german discrimination _comma_ the system gives very interesting results _comma_ achieving in one test 99.4 % correct assignments on real sentences .
5135,3,In passage  _comma_ the times evoked by the simple pasts are further ordered by the Explanation relation indicated by because _comma_ resulting in the backward progression of time .
5136,3,The feature values can be divided into two groups : those characterizing the style of the text this operator produces _comma_ and those concerning other planning aspects .
5137,3,We believe that the language involving copies of strings of matching brackets described in Example  cannot be generated by PLIG but _comma_ as shown in Example _comma_ it can be generated by PLTG and therefore PLPATR .
5138,2,On the other hand _comma_ sentences in the simple past are perfectly felicitous in standing alone or opening a discourse _comma_ introducing an asymmetry in accounts treating the simple past as anaphoric to a previously evoked time .
5139,3,The [ evidence-type ] annotation indicates the strength of evidence supporting the assumption .
5140,3,More precisely _comma_ motivated is one of the pragmatic roles that appear in a subordinate clause _comma_ and the constraints in subordinate clause are stated as identity relations between motivated and other semantic / pragmatic roles appearing in subordinate clause .
5141,3,For any context-free grammar _comma_ it is possible to express a weakly equivalent grammar using only rules of these forms .
5142,1,The system interprets an extended DCG formalism to produce a robust analyser that finds parses of the input made from ` islands ' of terminals ( corresponding to terminals consumed by successful grammar rules ) .
5143,2,They identified strategies that a system can adopt in justifying its beliefs ; however _comma_ they did not specify the criteria under which each of these strategies should be selected .
5144,5,The grammar is divided into modules which filter out ungrammatical structures at the various levels of representation ; these levels are related by general transformations .
5145,3,Run-time speed need only be enough to make the time spent on morphology small compared to sentential and contextual processing .
5146,3,While the former depends on static salience relating to the domain knowledge _comma_ the latter is similar to subsequent references _comma_ and is therefore sensitive to the context _comma_ in particular to its segmentation into attentional hierarchy .
5147,6,In this paper _comma_ we will mention our principles on natural language processing with regard to the ChAM model .
5148,3,A related issue concerns the interpretation of embedded Prolog code .
5149,3,We call these verbs inertial change of position ( ICoPs ) verbs .
5150,3,Finally _comma_ using and 2 with the two foregoing formulae _comma_ we deduce the desired result :
5151,3,It would be possible to classify and rank the proposed anchors before filtering them without any other changes to the algorithm .
5152,3,On the theoretical side we think that this result for SDL is also of some importance _comma_ since SDL exhibits a core of logical behaviour that any ( Lambek-based ) logic must have which accounts for non-peripheral extraction by some form of permutation .
5153,5,Since the overall mass left for unseen bigrams starting with  is given by
5154,3,Consider two infrequent adjectives that happen to modify different nouns in the corpus .
5155,3,Surprisingly _comma_ the resulting system SDL can be stated without the need for structural rules _comma_ i.e. _comma_ as a monolithic system with just one structural connective _comma_ because the ability of the abstracted-over formula to permute can be directly encoded in the right rule for  .
5156,3,We work with the following objects .
5157,3,Each of its nodes can hold activity _comma_ and it moves through the links .
5158,3,We also experimented with an application to language modeling for speech recognition _comma_ which yielded a statistically significant reduction in recognition error .
5159,3,This says that the relationship only holds between the property of being a car and some other object .
5160,3,The second type of mis-tagging was caused by wrong assignments of POS s by the guesser .
5161,3,where  and are activity ( at time T ) collected from the nodes referred in the rfrant and rfr respectively ; is activity given from outside ( at time T ) ; the output function limits the value to [ 0_comma_1 ] .
5162,3,Theorem 18 .
5163,3,The difficulty of distinguishing between non-attributive _comma_ adjectival usage of participles ( i.e. er ist geladen ) and participles proper ( i.e. er hat den Wagen geladen ) was mentioned in the preceding section .
5164,3,Formal approaches to grammatical theorising should reflect linguistic intuitions as directly as possible _comma_ otherwise they run the risk of being an obstacle _comma_ not an aid _comma_ to grammar development .
5165,4,For example _comma_ all the linguistic objects _comma_ such as words and phrases must be applied to so-called grammar rules to form grammatical structures or rational semantic representations _comma_ under a strict controller process .
5166,3,This research is funded by the UK Economic and Social Research Council _comma_ under grant R00023 4439 A Computational Model for the Phonology-Phonetics Interface in Tone Languages .
5167,3,While this framework does not restrict us to a particular grammar formalism _comma_ in our work we consider only probabilistic context-free grammars .
5168,2,In particular _comma_ we compared the performance of an MDL-based simulated annealing algorithm in hierarchical word clustering against that of one based on the Maximum Likelihood Estimator ( MLE _comma_ for short ) .
5169,4,Some presuppositions are inferrable when certain lexical constructs ( factives _comma_ aspectuals _comma_ etc ) or syntactic constructs ( cleft and pseudo-cleft sentences ) are used .
5170,3,extract collocations of nouns from a corpus of four kanzi character words .
5171,6,VM-GEN uses an extension of Tree Adjoining Grammars ( TAGs ) Joshi 1985 ) as its syntactic representation formalism that is not only adequate for the description of natural language but also supports incremental generation Kilger and Finkler 1994 .
5172,3,Finally _comma_ it is worth comparing  with Hyman 's and Stewart 's interpretation functions which were illustrated in .
5173,4,Consider the sentence :
5174,5,The purpose of steps  and is to observe the contra-indexing constraints .
5175,6,Perhaps the method proposed by Pereira et al. 1993 is the most relevant in our context .
5176,5,However _comma_ if there is a rhetorical relationship between two eventualities such as causation _comma_ elaboration or enablement _comma_ the temporal defaults can be overridden _comma_ as in the following examples :
5177,5,For instance _comma_ it takes longer for hearers to process a pronominalized noun phrase that is not in focus than one that is _comma_ while it takes longer to process a non-pronominalized noun phrase that is in focus than one that is not Guindon 1985 .
5178,3,In other words _comma_ if only ( P _comma_ Q ) holds then P satisfies Q and nothing else does .
5179,3,Therefore _comma_ it is important to recover extragrammatical sentences using syntactic factors only _comma_ which are independent of any particular system and any particular domain .
5180,3,The move involved is analogous to the way first order logic ( a so-called ` extensional ' logic ) can be extended to cope with intensional notions such as belief and necessity .
5181,3,Other estimation formulae have been used in the past .
5182,2,In the previous scheme _comma_ these must be specified manually _comma_ and the choice is left to the designer 's intuitions .
5183,1,The present paper is concerned with tagging languages and sublanguages for which no a priori knowledge about grammatical categories is available _comma_ a situation that occurs often in practice Brill and Marcus 1992a .
5184,3,Therefore the tag `` ADN '' was introduced for uses of adjectives _comma_ nouns _comma_ and participles as adnominal modifiers .
5185,5,Tagsets used in the past have included varying amounts of detail .
5186,3,Although the type of reference that we wish to model does not rely on these assumptions _comma_ we can nevertheless draw from these theories .
5187,4,The answer seems to lie in addressing the concept which underlies the union of adjective and noun in these three cases _comma_ i.e. _comma_ intensification _comma_ and hence establish a single meaning representation for the adjectives which can be viewed as an interlingual pivot for translation .
5188,3,Each entry of Glossme is mapped onto a node of Paradigme in the following way .
5189,4,The application of a morphographemic rule may have constraints as on which lexical morphemes it may or may not apply .
5190,3,For example _comma_ consider the sentence :
5191,3,Just as quantification over possible states of affairs yields analyses of intensional phenomena _comma_ so quantification over related models could provide a ` denotational semantics ' for  .
5192,3,The key claim of this section is that agents monitor the effects of their utterance actions and that the next action by the addressee is taken as evidence of the effect of the speaker 's utterance .
5193,3,I would like to thank Aravind Joshi _comma_ Dale Miller _comma_ Jong Park _comma_ and Mark Steedman for valuable discussions and comments on earlier drafts .
5194,5,For non-pronominal reference markers the surface string is used as the index .
5195,3,It covers Semitic errors relating to vocalisation _comma_ diacritics _comma_ phonetic syncopation and morphographemic idiosyncrasies .
5196,3,parsing models must rely heavily on lexical and contextual information to analyze sentences accurately ; and
5197,3,Ideally every interpretable utterance should have one and only one analysis for any interpretation of it .
5198,4,Here the two cases of drive are phonologically identical _comma_ but have different syntactic categories .
5199,3,One of the most important issues in the induction of guessing rule-sets is the choice right data for training .
5200,4,Since agents are autonomous and heterogeneous _comma_ it is inevitable that conflicts in their beliefs arise during the planning process .
5201,3,LHIP is based on the assumption that partial results can be useful ( often much more useful than no result at all ) _comma_ and that an approximation to complete coverage is more useful when it comes with indications of how approximate it is .
5202,5,where c ( W ) denotes the count of the word sequence W in the training data .
5203,3,In particular _comma_ we tested to see how effective the patterns acquired by our method are in a structural disambiguation experiment .
5204,3,Once the full set of possible lexical entries for a sentence is collected _comma_ they can _comma_ if required _comma_ then be converted back into a set of phrase structure rules ( which should correspond to a small subset of the rule based formalism equivalent to the whole lexicalised grammar ) _comma_ before being parsing with a standard algorithm such as Earley 1970 's .
5205,2,In experiments comparing SPATTER with IBM 's computer manuals parser _comma_ SPATTER significantly outperforms the grammar-based parser .
5206,6,We adopt a suggestion by Chierchia in Partee 1984 _comma_ that the whole implication be rendered as a state .
5207,3,Fully 96 % of the test sentences ( all but 5 ) are parsable by GLR* .
5208,3,Only when no top-down presentation operator is applicable _comma_ will a bottom-up presentation operator be chosen .
5209,3,This results in typical compilation times of about a minute _comma_ and has allowed a reasonably full _comma_ feature-based description of French inflectional morphology to be developed in about a month by a linguist new to the system .
5210,3,I am indebted to SIL Cameroon for their logistical support on my field trip in September and October of 1993 _comma_ during which the data presented in the paper ( and much other data besides ) was gathered _comma_ and especially to Nancy Haynes _comma_ Gretchen Harro for helping me collect the data and Jean-Claude Gnintedem who endured many recording sessions .
5211,3,We demonstrate our model on the Arabic verbal stems shown in  McCarthy 1981 .
5212,3,To collect a bigger number of examples for each verbal complement _comma_ projecting the complements in the internal arguments _comma_ using diathesis sub-categorization rules .
5213,3,It is also possible for a QLF to be uninterpretable ; to specify no possible evaluation .
5214,3,Motivation and exemplification for the model is provided by data taken from my fieldwork on Bamileke Dschang ( Cameroon ) .
5215,1,We have implemented a computational plan-based model that accounts for the collaborative nature of reference in the domain of interactive direction-giving .
5216,3,The symbol ` @ ' introduces a terminal string .
5217,3,For a sentence to be judged as correct all the noun phrases must be correct .
5218,3,In fact _comma_ the only clause in the satisfaction definition which is at all complex is that for  .
5219,3,The Rpt can be either an event or a time discourse marker _comma_ already present in the DRS ( recorded as assignment Rpt : = e ) .
5220,3,Although in general the performance of the cascading guesser is only 6 % worse than the lookup of a general language lexicon there is room for improvement .
5221,4,Therefore _comma_ a mechanism to analyze the structure of a compound noun from the individual nouns is necessary .
5222,1,The current paper shows how to implement this general notion _comma_ without following Krifka 's analysis in detail .
5223,7,whether the form leaves behind an empty constituent in the syntax _comma_ and
5224,7,analyzing the performance of the learning process .
5225,3,This parser has been trained to find the syntactic subject head that agrees in number with the main verb .
5226,3,There remain such essential problems as identifying the differing linguistic structures that characterize the dialects _comma_ and discovering their history .
5227,5,Conscious garden paths _comma_ such as  below _comma_ are locally ambiguous sentences which give rise to reanalysis that is both experimentally detectable and causes a conscious sensation of difficulty or `` surprise effect '' .
5228,1,We address the problem of automatically acquiring case frame patterns ( selectional patterns ) from large corpus data .
5229,3,This component was implemented as part of a discourse grammar for English .
5230,6,This system plays the role of the dialogue manager in the TRAINS dialogue system _comma_ which acts as an intelligent planning assistant in a transportation domain .
5231,1,However our objective is not to propose a faster algorithm _comma_ but is to show the possibility of distributed processing of natural languages .
5232,3,can overlap with e if
5233,4,In recent years there has been a common agreement in the NLP research community on the importance of having an extensive coverage of selectional restrictions ( SRs ) tuned to the domain to work with .
5234,3,The second part of the table shows that the cascading application of the morphological rule-sets together with the ending-guessing rules increases the overall precision of the guessing by a further 5 % .
5235,2,The third task involves naturally-occurring data _comma_ and in this task our algorithm does not perform as well as n-gram models but vastly outperforms the Inside-Outside algorithm .
5236,5,The traditional approach has been to plot isoglosses _comma_ delineating regions where the same word is used for the same concept _comma_ or perhaps the same pronunciation for the same phoneme .
5237,3,There are three main problems still remaining .
5238,3,For notational convenience we abbreviate  by and similarly by _comma_ but note that this is just an abbreviation in the product-free fragment .
5239,3,The paper demonstrates that exponential complexities with respect to grammar size and input length have little impact on the performance of three unification-based parsing algorithms _comma_ using a wide-coverage grammar .
5240,7,One such approach is outlined below .
5241,3,Furthermore _comma_ the semantic function of the object is specified as ` agent ' but no verb defined yet  in the head object .
5242,3,But if we can use this mechanism to construct an abstraction as the interpretation of a relative clause _comma_ we can also use it to construct an abstraction as the interpretation of a phrase containing a focussed item .
5243,3,Heads serve as anchor-points in the input string around which islands may be formed _comma_ and are accordingly treated before non-head items ( RHS items are re-ordered during compilation-see below ) .
5244,4,We are concerned here with a particular fact about gapping noticed by Levin and Prince 1982 _comma_ namely that gapping is acceptable only with the purely conjunctive symmetric meaning of and conjoining the clauses _comma_ and not with its causal asymmetric meaning ( paraphraseable by `` and as a result '' ) .
5245,5,if an observer is introduced in the subordinate clause _comma_ the mentally responsible person appearing in the main clause is identical with the observer .
5246,5,The statistical technique of factor analysis can be used to discover categories _comma_ like Biber has done .
5247,5,The essential difference is that constraining equations require that the feature under consideration already has a value _comma_ whereas defining equations apply independently of the feature value instantiation level .
5248,3,does not require the use of higher-order unification for dealing with quantifiers .
5249,5,In  there is a causal relationship between Mary 's pushing John and his falling _comma_ and the second event is understood to precede the first .
5250,3,In this table we can see some examples of the five types of manual diagnostic :
5251,3,Since complete specification of transfer operations is not required for correct generation of grammatical target text _comma_ the version of Shake-and-Bake translation presented here maintains its advantage over traditional transfer models _comma_ in this respect .
5252,3,A possible derivation for this grammar constructs the following ( abbreviated ) parse tree in figure  .
5253,3,If the penalty calculation mentioned above is accomplished for the rhetorical structure shown in Fig.  _comma_ each penalty score is calculated as shown in Fig. .
5254,3,We showed that warrants are useful when the task requires agreement on the warrant _comma_ when the warrant is not currently salient _comma_ when retrieval of the warrant is indeterminate _comma_ or when retrieval has some associated cost _comma_ and that warrants hinder performance if communication is costly and if the warrant can displace information that is needed to complete the task _comma_ e.g. when AWM is very limited and warrants are not required to be shared .
5255,4,SRs must include information on the syntactic position of the words that are being restricted semantically .
5256,6,With the help of this ontology we have realized a typology for intransitive motion verbs .
5257,3,Here the value of ` 1 ' indicates the presence of the case slot in question _comma_ and ` 0 ' absence .
5258,3,The system analyzes inter-paragraph structures after the analysis of intra-paragraph structures .
5259,6,We have shown how the essentials of the ECD analysis can be embedded in the lexicon and grammar of a unification based theory of language .
5260,3,One word in this purview is in focus at a time .
5261,3,We show that our use of off-line grammar optimization overcomes problems with empty or displaced heads .
5262,3,The basis of the stochastic procedure for generating fully-inequated feature structures is to interleave the generation of equivalence classes with the expansion from the initial node as described above .
5263,4,The problem of tagset design becomes particularly important for highly inflected languages _comma_ such as Greek or Hungarian .
5264,3,for each  and each _comma_ iff is defined _comma_ is defined _comma_ and _comma_ and
5265,2,However _comma_ there are cases where a single constituent appears to yield more than one contribution to the meaning of an utterance .
5266,3,If used in a rule body _comma_ they indicate that input is potentially ignored-the problems that ignore rules are intended to repair will not always occur _comma_ in which case the rules succeed without consuming any input .
5267,3,One of the most striking features of LFG ( and indeed _comma_ GPSG ) is the way that purely structural ( that is _comma_ model theoretic ) argumentation dominates .
5268,7,In this section we consider different variations on the association score in order to make it more robust .
5269,2,Because of this separation _comma_ they do not have to assume co-operation on the tasks each agent is performing _comma_ but still require recognition of intention and co-operation at the conversational level .
5270,3,More specifically _comma_ we model senses as probabilistic concepts or clusters c with corresponding cluster membership probabilities  for each word w .
5271,3,Note that the system generates and understands utterances in the form of descriptions of the surface speech actions _comma_ not surface natural language forms .
5272,3,Despite the hypothesis that the free word order of German leads to poor performance of low order HMM taggers when compared with a language like English _comma_ the overall results for German are very much along the lines of comparable implementations for English _comma_ if not better .
5273,3,Suppose for sake of argument that the ratio of L to the immediately preceding H in Figure  is constant _comma_ with respect to the baselines for H and L _comma_ namely h and l .
5274,3,The implementation of coordination crucially uses the capability of  -Prolog for universal quantification in the goal of a clause .
5275,3,Because of considerations like these _comma_ our aim in the implementation work was to treat tense _comma_ aspect _comma_ cue words and rhetorical relations as mutually constraining _comma_ with more specific information such as explicit cue words having higher priority than less specific information such as tense .
5276,3,In examples of grammars _comma_ variables begin with a capital letter .
5277,3,A LHIP grammar rule has the form :
5278,3,Also _comma_ both analysis and generation of word forms are required .
5279,3,The reference texts were also taken from the Frankfurter Rundschau _comma_ but do not overlap with the training texts .
5280,3,Achieving understanding is not unproblematic _comma_ it is a process that must be managed _comma_ just as other goal achieving processes are Clark and Schaefer 1989 .
5281,4,Furthermore _comma_ the need to perform non-destructive unification means that a large proportion of the processing time is spent copying feature structures .
5282,2,A second problem with previous research is that the criteria for identifying discourse structure are not always made explicit .
5283,2,Also _comma_ since none of these studies relate observed performance to that of other comparable parsing systems _comma_ implementational oversights may not be apparent and so be a confounding factor in any general conclusions made .
5284,1,In this paper we investigate whether the same techniques can be applied in case the grammar is a constraint-based grammar rather than a CFG .
5285,3,These principles indirectly provide a means to ensure mutual belief .
5286,2,Here _comma_ we restrict our attention on ` hard clustering ' ( i.e. _comma_ each word must belong to exactly one class ) _comma_ in part because we are interested in comparing the thesauri constructed by our method with existing hand-made thesauri .
5287,3,An action is obligatory if it is not permissible not to do it .
5288,3,determining how to handle underspecifications _comma_ and
5289,4,In this case _comma_ the generator either has to use a default or formulate a request for clarification in order to be able to continue its processing _comma_ i.e. _comma_ to produce an utterance .
5290,3,Thus _comma_ selecting some particular node as a cutnode may cause other nodes to also become cutnodes _comma_ even though their entropies are not above the threshold .
5291,7,Below we describe parts of the discourse model in more detail and then show how it is used to account for aspects of this dialogue .
5292,3,We do not have a fully satisfactory solution to this problem .
5293,3,Lists successful rules _comma_ indicating island position and coverage .
5294,3,And _comma_ we are now applying it to text segmentation Grosz and Sidner 1986 _comma_ Youmans 1991 _comma_ i.e. to capture the shifts of coherent scenes in a story .
5295,3,However _comma_ since control is explicitly allocated to the instructor in TODs _comma_ there is no reason for that participant to believe that the other has any contribution to make .
5296,5,Like Earley 's algorithm _comma_ all of these approaches operate top-down ( backward chaining ) .
5297,5,A text generator based on the local organization _comma_ in contrast _comma_ repeatedly chooses a part of the remaining task and carries it out .
5298,4,Semantic relation :
5299,5,Another candidate is the property sharing thoery Kameyama 1988 .
5300,3,Each type denotes a set of objects in I .
5301,5,Recently _comma_ Suzuki proposed an algorithm to approximately learn a multi-dimensional joint distribution expressible as a ` dendroid distribution _comma_ ' which is both efficient and theoretically sound Suzuki 1993 .
5302,3,The concrete operator is omitted .
5303,3,The bases are transferred but the representation of the collocate is shared between the source and the target representation .
5304,5,Following Mikami 's idea _comma_ Minami proposed four levels _comma_ namely level A _comma_ B _comma_ C and D which correspond roughly to VP _comma_ proposition _comma_ sentence without communication mood and utterance which takes into account a hearer _comma_ respectively .
5305,3,Since top-down operators embody explicit communicative norms _comma_ they are always given a higher priority .
5306,3,Preliminary experiments showed that distributional methods distinguish adnominal and predicative uses of adjectives ( e.g. `` the black cat '' vs. `` the cat is black '' ) .
5307,3,From this output it can be seen that the grammar manages reasonably well with noun phrases _comma_ but is unable to deal with questions ( the initial auxiliary have remains unattached ) .
5308,5,For example _comma_ a bigram model may be replaced by a trigram one _comma_ and the fact that dependencies exist among the likelihoods of occurrence of grammar rules at different locations in a parse tree can be modeled by associating probabilities with states in a parsing table rather than simply with the rules themselves Briscoe and Carroll 1993 .
5309,5,Recent proposals include the use of probabilistic methods Briscoe and Carroll 1993 and large robust deterministic systems like Hindle 's Fidditch Hindle 1989 .
5310,4,As another example _comma_ consider a case in which the agent 's goals are such that it prefers that an interrogating agent not find out the requested information .
5311,4,Abstract generation is _comma_ like Machine Translation _comma_ one of the ultimate goal of Natural Language Processing .
5312,3,The headed list distinguishes between the two cases _comma_ with only the first having an np on its headed list _comma_ allowing prediction of an s modifier .
5313,3,As much as possible _comma_ detailed information is entered in the transfer dictionaries to allow the translation process itself to be made simple .
5314,3,Also _comma_ when several structures are possible we can narrow the possibilities by using preferences _comma_ as in the examples below :
5315,3,Neither the observation that trigrams may represent the limit of usefulness for N-gram modeling in ATIS _comma_ nor that non-trivial contextual influences exist between occurrences of grammar rules _comma_ is very novel or remarkable in its own right .
5316,3,I am grateful to Manny Rayner and Ian Lewin for useful comments on earlier versions of this paper .
5317,3,This suggests that _comma_ when considering the complexity of parsers _comma_ the issue of parse table size is of minor importance for realistic NL grammars ( as long as an implementation represents the table compactly ) _comma_ and that improvements to complexity results with respect to grammar size _comma_ although interesting from a theoretical standpoint _comma_ may have little practical relevance for the processing of natural language .
5318,3,is a signature iff [ is a sextuple _comma_
5319,3,When the Xerox guesser is applied after the E  guesser no sufficient changes to the performance are noticed .
5320,5,According to MDL _comma_ the model which minimizes the sum total of the two types of description lengths should be selected .
5321,5,In linguistic phenomena _comma_ these observations are similar to the constraint we propose here .
5322,3,The important part of semantics of complex sentence is captured as relations among semantic roles in subordinate and main clause respectively .
5323,1,We propose a bottom-up variant of Earley deduction .
5324,3,This enables constraints on LFG 's composite ontology ( c-structures synchronised with f-structures ) to be stated directly ; no appeal to the LFG construction algorithm is needed .
5325,5,Evidence was given that VP-ellipsis copies syntactic representations in what was termed parallel constructions ( predicting the unacceptability of the voice mismatch in example  and nominalized source in example ) _comma_ but copies semantic representations in non-parallel constructions ( predicting the acceptability of the voice mismatch in example and the nominalized source in example ) :
5326,3,They can be divided into the thirty four categories which are exemplified in Table  .
5327,5,Note that ` Comment ' appearing in ` Sub-Clause ' has the same structure as ` Comment ' appearing just below ` Judgement ' .
5328,3,Evaluation measures for the Selectional Restrictions learning task are discussed .
5329,3,Learning process .
5330,3,In the last section _comma_ we deliberately illustrated an initial guess which was as bad as possible .
5331,4,Because of the inevitable differences in their beliefs about the world -- specifically about what is salient -- the agents may have to collaborate to make the expression adequate .
5332,1,Finally it showed how dynamics can be used as a formal description of processing accounts which use a full parsing history _comma_ and how the characterisations of parsing states can be chosen to enforce the requisite degree of parallelism between conjuncts .
5333,5,Hobbs has applied COHERENCE RELATIONS to face-to-face conversation in which mixed-initiative is displayed by participants Hobbs and Agar 1985 _comma_ Hobbs 1979 .
5334,4,On the one hand _comma_ SRs are an interesting information to be included in dictionaries ( defining in context approach ) .
5335,4,Such a grammar might be called the parse-forest grammar .
5336,3,Intuitively _comma_ to say that  is valid in is to say that the constraint holds universally ; it is a completely general fact about .
5337,3,If p is about an action _comma_ B may want to partially modify p with additional constraints about how _comma_ or when p .
5338,3,These ignore rules can be invoked individually or as a class .
5339,1,Work described below is aimed at evaluating the effectiveness of shallow ( sub-sentential ) processing and the feasibility of cooperative error checking _comma_ through building and testing appropriately an error-processing system .
5340,2,Green 1992 assumes that implicatures are connected to discourse entities and not to utterances _comma_ but her approach still does not allow cancellations across discourse units .
5341,3,The mental actions in the intermediate plans determine the confidence values of each attribute ( from the hearer 's salience hierarchy ) _comma_ and add them up .
5342,4,On the other hand _comma_ if the evaluation indicates that the agent should maintain her original belief _comma_ she should attempt to provide sufficient justification to convince the other agent to adopt this belief if the belief is relevant to the task at hand .
5343,3,And the critical issues of investigating the most appropriate network architectures will be carried on .
5344,3,We model this decision as a search for a node in the tree at which an explicitly defined parsing operation _comma_ tree-lowering may be applied .
5345,4,In this dialogue _comma_ speaker B is not confident that he will be able to identify the intersection at Lowell Street _comma_ and so suggests that the intersection might be marked .
5346,5,First _comma_ we used a tagger which was a C++ re-implementation of the LISP implemented HMM Xerox tagger described in Kupiec 1992 .
5347,4,That is _comma_ language may vary geographically in many dimensions _comma_ but the requirements we usually impose require that a specific site be placed in a unique dialect .
5348,3,We composed this lexicon with finite-state transducers ( mapping rules ) in order to produce a new lexical transducer with the new tagset .
5349,3,Here we have extracted the denotation of peach as the property of being a peach _comma_ and converted the interpretation of the VP to an abstraction which will combine appropriately with this property to reproduce the original interpretation .
5350,3,If an embedded sentence such as John likes Sue is a mapping from an s / s to an s _comma_ this suggests that it might be possible to treat all sentences as mapping from some category expecting an s to that category i.e. from X / s to X .
5351,5,Unlike the within-language associations _comma_ which are rich and diverse _comma_ these between-language associations involve primarily translation equivalent terms that are experienced together frequently .
5352,3,Also _comma_ to make the length of the abstract shorter _comma_ It is necessary to utilize an inner-sentence analysis and to realize a phrase-selection-type abstract generation based on it .
5353,2,Moreover _comma_ only one word error was considered though several word errors can occur simultaneously in the running text .
5354,3,The present composition function is simple addition _comma_ but one could envision more complex systems to compute confidence _comma_ such as an algebra of confidence or a non-numeric system .
5355,5,Elsie 1986 grouped the Gaelic dialects on the basis of whether the vocabulary matched .
5356,5,The alternative approach _comma_ exemplified by the work of Stabler on top-down parsing Stabler 1991 _comma_ and Pulman on left-corner parsing Pulman 1986 is to associate a semantics directly with the partial structures formed during a top-down or left-corner parse .
5357,3,From this suggestion the initiator might expand her expression to the tall funny-looking building .
5358,3,This gives us a means of efficiently storing the potentially unbounded feature structures associated with nodes in a derivation tree ( derived feature structures ) .
5359,3,This account replaces that assumption with a model in which the evidence of the hearer must be considered to establish mutual beliefs .
5360,3,Thus _comma_  becomes a set of links : _comma_ where is a link with thickness .
5361,3,To do this it was necessary first to classify control shifts according to whether they resulted in shifts of topic .
5362,3,Somewhat more surprisingly _comma_ even for short sentences which were not problematic for Whitelock 's system _comma_ the generation component has performed consistently better .
5363,3,We can also narrow the possibilities when no cue word is present by using constraints based on observations of tense and aspect interactions such as those shown in Table  .
5364,3,The optimal evaluation order of the right-hand side categories is found by comparing the maximal degree of nondeterminacy introduced by the evaluation of the individual categories with the degree of nondeterminacy the grammar is allowed to introduce : if the degree of nondeterminacy introduced by the evaluation of one of the right-hand side categories in a rule exceeds the admissible degree of nondeterminacy the ordering at hand is rejected .
5365,3,Change of posture ( CoPtu ) verbs ( s 'asseoir - to sit down ; se baisser-to bend down ) .
5366,3,We looked at the effectiveness of our parse quality heuristic in identifying such bad parses .
5367,3,Proposition 10 .
5368,3,The meaning constructors for the lexical items are given in Figure  .
5369,2,In addition _comma_ we restrict the summation to sufficiently similar words _comma_ whereas the cooccurrence smoothing method sums over all words in the lexicon .
5370,3,Perhaps the procedural aspects are there more or less by accident ?
5371,3,This distinction can be justified monolingually for the other languages that we treat ( English _comma_ French _comma_ and Japanese ) .
5372,4,However _comma_ there are actually any number of such syntax trees corresponding to _comma_ for example _comma_ the first semantic representation _comma_ since the np and the s can be arbitrarily far apart .
5373,3,In this work _comma_ we re-used an existing lexicon .
5374,3,A more substantial variation would be to base the model on similarity between conditioned words rather than on similarity between conditioning words .
5375,4,Recently _comma_ there has been a lot of interest in Earley deduction Pereira and Warren 1983 with applications to parsing and generation Shieber 1988 _comma_ Gerdeman 1991 _comma_ Johnson 1993 _comma_ Doerre 1993 .
5376,5,Thus _comma_ the notion of what is informative is judged against a background of what is presupposed _comma_ i.e. propositions that all conversants assume are mutually known or believed .
5377,4,The speaker attempts to achieve this goal by building a description of the object that she believes will give the hearer the ability to identify it when it is possible to do so .
5378,3,When a different participant assumes control of a discourse subgoal then a control shift occurs and the participants must have mechanisms for achieving this .
5379,3,It is not that the transfer of information per se compromises the ideal -- such information must often appear in transfer entries to avoid grammatical but incorrect translation ( e.g. a great man translated as un homme grand ) .
5380,3,Finally _comma_ `` # s '' indicates the number of actual noun senses used in the corpus which are contained in the class .
5381,3,We then formalize the dependencies between case slots as the probabilistic dependencies between these random variables .
5382,5,Magic ( templates ) is a general compilation technique for efficient bottom-up evaluation of logic programs developed in the deductive database community Ramakrishnan et al. 1992 .
5383,5,The analysis is based on a classification of utterances into 4 types .
5384,3,Transfer specifications may be incrementally refined and empirically tested for efficiency .
5385,3,The occurrence of IRU 's in dialogue has many ramifications for a model of dialogue .
5386,3,The support ADs resulted from a client phoning an expert to help them diagnose and repair various software faults .
5387,3,Moving further in the direction of class-based language models _comma_ we plan to consider additional distributional relations ( for instance _comma_ adjective-noun ) and apply the results of clustering to the grouping of lexical associations in lexicalized grammar frameworks such as stochastic lexicalized tree-adjoining grammars Schabes 1992 .
5388,2,In a problem like parsing _comma_ where long-distance lexical information is crucial to disambiguate interpretations accurately _comma_ local models like probabilistic context-free grammars are inadequate .
5389,4,Thus the intersection of a FSA and a CFG is a CFG that exactly derives all parse-trees .
5390,6,This finding confirms the idea that distribution and phonotactics are useful sources of information that infants might use in discovering words Jusczyk et al. 1993b .
5391,3,First _comma_ variations of  may be tried _comma_ such as different similarity metrics and different weighting schemes .
5392,7,Then I briefly describe the training and parsing procedures used in SPATTER .
5393,6,We then use discriminant analysis _comma_ a technique from descriptive statistics .
5394,3,The Explanation relation denotes a cause-effect relationship with reversed clause ordering _comma_ as in sentences  .
5395,1,We describe a probabilistic word association model based on distributional word similarity _comma_ and apply it to improving probability estimates for unseen word bigrams in a variant of Katz 's back-off model .
5396,5,Stalnaker _comma_ as well _comma_ suggests that to assert something that is already presupposed is to attempt to do something that is already done Stalnaker 1978 .
5397,3,But in that case _comma_ it appears that checking the applicability of a production at some point in a derivation must entail the comparison of structures of unbounded size .
5398,3,This theoretical bound might suggest that parsing performance would be severely degraded on long sentences ; however _comma_ the relationship between length of sentence and parse time with the ANLT grammar and the sentences tested appears to be approximately only quadratic .
5399,3,However simple devices such as cue words may go a long way toward determining this structure .
5400,3,Once the PP has been attached as an argument of the verb _comma_ it can never be reanalysed as the adjunct of the preceding NP _comma_ because the NP will precede the PP before reanalysis _comma_ and dominate it after reanalysis _comma_ which is against the `` exclusivity condition '' on trees ( i.e. no two nodes may stand in both a dominance and a precedence relation ) .
5401,3,The parser does not require fragments of sentences to form constituents _comma_ and thereby avoids problems of spurious ambiguity .
5402,4,Furthermore _comma_ SRs may help the parser when deciding the semantic role played by a syntactic complement .
5403,5,His method is supported by a small 4 rule grammar .
5404,3,In this case _comma_ however _comma_ we do not account for the known words which were mis-tagged because of the guessers .
5405,3,The generated abstracts were evaluated from the point of view of key sentence coverage .
5406,3,Only those path sets S are considered which satisfy the property that the extensions of each path in S are identical .
5407,3,the island associated with the rule as a whole extends from D to E and covers F items _comma_ where F is U + Q + T ;
5408,3,The words in the sentence are clearly necessary to make parsing decisions _comma_ and in some cases long-distance structural information is also needed .
5409,5,An obvious way to implement a generation procedure ( see Fig.  ) is to relate the input semantics with the start symbol of the grammar and then to try to expand this node in a top-down manner according to the rules specified in the grammar .
5410,3,If the configuration includes more elements _comma_ it is necessary to adjust the method _comma_ along the lines discussed above for trigrams .
5411,3,Alternative mapping rules were developed to generate a lexicon with ELWIS tags from the German lexical database of the Centre for Lexical Information CELEX 1993 .
5412,3,We expand the ambiguity to 15 possible structures .
5413,3,Writing these as  _comma_ and respectively _comma_ the transition probability from tag i to tag j is estimated as and the lexical probability as .
5414,3,B may prefer doing or believing some q where p is mutually exclusive with q _comma_
5415,3,The set of default preconditions is applied to all objects ( OBJ ) of VM-GEN in order to test the kind of underspecification ( ` number ' in the example ) .
5416,3,The model also has the further commendation that it predicts correctly the observed proportion of left-branching compounds found in two independently extracted test sets .
5417,3,Another important conclusion from the evaluation experiments is that the morphological guessing rules do improve the guessing performance .
5418,3,Verb and noun are the lemmas of the inflected forms appearing in text .
5419,3,We mean by multilinguality that the same processing is applied for different languages .
5420,3,The technique demonstrated above has an obvious application in information retrieval _comma_ for picking out interesting texts _comma_ if content based methods select a too large set for easy manipulation and browsing Cutting et al. 1992 .
5421,6,We employ Suzuki 's algorithm to learn case frame patterns as dendroid distributions .
5422,6,We use ordinary co-occurrence statistics and measure the co-occurrence likelihood between two words _comma_ X and Y _comma_ by the mutual information estimate Church and Hanks 1989 .
5423,3,where  are the average and the standard deviation of
5424,5,However _comma_ both approaches can just as well take a declarative grammar specification as input to produce generator and / or parser-oriented grammars as in Dymetman et al. 1990 .
5425,3,But we have seen that this level of detail and complexity is necessary if one want to understand _comma_ to formalize and to compute a right spatiotemporal semantics for motion complexes .
5426,4,The latter case is more interesting : most of the French motion verbs are intransitive and the interaction between motion verbs and spatial prepositions gives detailed informations about the way human beeings mentally represent spatiotemporal aspects of a motion .
5427,3,k and t are parameters that control the contents of  and are tuned experimentally _comma_ as we will see below .
5428,2,However standard formalisations of LFG do not capture its strikingly simple underlying intuitions .
5429,3,The claim here is that both understanding and acceptance are monitored .
5430,5,Recently _comma_ several approaches on acquiring different kinds of lexical information from corpora have been developed Basili et al. 1992 _comma_ Church et al. 1991 _comma_ Church and Hanks 1990 _comma_ Resnik 1992 .
5431,7,The structure of this paper is as follows : Section  explains the knowledge for structure analysis of compound nouns and the procedures to acquire it from a corpus _comma_ Section describes the analysis algorithm _comma_ and Section describes the experiments that are conducted to evaluate the performance of our method _comma_ and Section summarizes the paper and discusses future research directions .
5432,3,There are two levels to improve sentences categorization : a level below using words morphology and a level above using text structure .
5433,3,The typical grammatical categories of the connective expressions are connectives and sentence predicates .
5434,3,Generally _comma_ the guesser does not recognise words belonging to closed classes ( conjunctions _comma_ prepositions _comma_ etc. ) under the assumption that closed classes are fully described in the basic lexicon .
5435,6,For our analysis of gapping _comma_ we follow Sag 1976 in hypothesizing that a post-surface-structure level of syntactic representation is used as the basis for interpretation .
5436,5,Brill addresses the problem of finding a valid metric for distituency by using a generalized mutual information statistic .
5437,7,First we consider the features of Mel'cuk 's treatment that we have wanted to preserve .
5438,5,Babitch and Lebrun 1989 did a similar analysis based on the varying pronunciation of /r/ .
5439,3,From the table _comma_ we can see that reducing k to 30 incurs a penalty of less than 1 % in the perplexity improvement _comma_ so relatively low values of k appear to be sufficient to achieve most of the benefit of the similarity model .
5440,4,In naive implementations of unification grammar parsers _comma_ feature structures play the same role as nonterminals in standard context-free grammar parsers .
5441,3,The framework yields an algorithm that computes the conversational _comma_ conventional _comma_ scalar _comma_ clausal _comma_ and normal state implicatures ; and the presuppositions that are associated with utterances .
5442,3,for each  _comma_ each and each _comma_ if runs to q ' in F _comma_ and runs to q ' in F then _comma_ and
5443,6,We view this problem as that of estimating a joint distribution over the Cartesian product of a partition of a set of nouns and a partition of a set of verbs _comma_ and propose a learning algorithm based on the Minimum Description Length ( MDL ) Principle for such estimation .
5444,4,Many low-probability bigrams will be missing from any finite sample .
5445,3,Which of them correspond to grammatical utterances of English ?
5446,4,It therefore seems that the deleted words must have the same major syntactic category _comma_ and the same lexical meaning .
5447,3,Tense _comma_ aspect _comma_ rhetorical relations and temporal expressions affect the value of the RHET_RELN type that expresses the relationship between two DCUs : cue words are lexically marked according to what rhetorical relation they specify _comma_ and this relation is passed on to the DCU .
5448,4,We must choose the correct segmentation _comma_ `` SinGata ( new ) / Kansetu ( indirect ) / Zei ( tax ) '' and analyze structure .
5449,3,Our ideal _comma_ then _comma_ is the set of clusters that maximizes the cluster-dependent corpus likelihood  .
5450,3,The confidence value of a tall building is 3 _comma_ and so this attribute is less salient than architectural style .
5451,3,Clusters are used as the basis for class models of word coocurrence _comma_ and the models evaluated with respect to held-out test data .
5452,2,This differentiates collaborative negotiation from argumentation Birnbaum et al. 1980 _comma_ Reichman 1981 _comma_ Cohen 1987 _comma_ Quilici 1992 .
5453,6,The approach which we will adopt here is based on Milward 1992 _comma_ Milward 1994a .
5454,5,In each case _comma_ one begins with known semantic categories ( WordNet synsets _comma_ Roget 's numbered classes ) and non-sense-annotated text _comma_ and proceeds to a distributional characterization of semantic category behavior using co-occurrence relationships .
5455,3,As for lhip_phrase / 2 _comma_ except that all of the input must be covered .
5456,1,We have explored an information theoretical neural network Gorin and Levinson 1989 that can acquire the verbal associations in the dual-coding theory .
5457,3,Firstly _comma_ in both languages _comma_ the unknown words from the second experiment were looked up in the lexicon trained from the full corpus to see what tags they might have .
5458,3,IRU 's such as PROMPTS _comma_ REPETITIONS _comma_ PARAPHRASES _comma_ and making an INFERENCE explicit cannot function as evidence for conflicts in beliefs or intentions via their propositional content since they are informationally redundant .
5459,3,To conclude we would like to discuss  definitions .
5460,3,The numbers presented in the previous section are intuitively unsatisfying .
5461,3,We repeat this process until we can no longer find a modification that improves the current hypothesis grammar .
5462,3,This _comma_ actually _comma_ did not come as a surprise _comma_ since many main forms required by the suffix rules were missing in the lexicon .
5463,3,a set of initial transition biases _comma_
5464,3,As it is to be used with real data _comma_ the formalism should be able to characterize the wide range of syntactic structures found in actual language use _comma_ including those normally excluded by competence grammars as belonging to the `` periphery '' of the language or as being `` ungrammatical '' .
5465,3,One final observation about the experiments : the accuracy on unknown words was very low in all of the tests _comma_ and was particularly bad in Swedish .
5466,3,The reader easily verifies that indeed this grammar generates ( a isomorphism of ) the single parse tree of this example _comma_ assuming of course that the start symbol for this parse-forest grammar is  .
5467,3,Under these conditions _comma_ the tree set shown in Figure  can be generated .
5468,3,That is _comma_ we ask ourselves what kind of constraints the linguist wishes to impose _comma_ and then devise a language in which they can be stated .
5469,2,For learning or meanings from example words _comma_ distance vectors gave remarkably higher precision than co-occurrence vectors .
5470,4,Downdrift is the automatic lowering of the second of two H tones when an L intervenes _comma_ so HLH is realised as  rather than as _comma_ while downstep is the lowering of the second of two tones when an intervening L is lost _comma_ so H H is realised as  Hyman and Schuh 1974 .
5471,1,While it may be worthwhile to base such a model on preexisting sense classes Resnik 1992 _comma_ in the work described here we look at how to derive the classes directly from distributional data .
5472,3,The algorithm is evaluated on the Brown Corpus .
5473,3,In 59 % to 82 % of the cases both algorithms get the correct result .
5474,3,After  _comma_ since the propositional content of is inferrable _comma_ the assumption that Harry has made this inference is supported by the inference evidence type :
5475,5,Although it is still used for linguistic description Bouma and van Noord 1994 _comma_ it has been somewhat overshadowed in recent years by HPSG Pollard and Sag 1994 _comma_ and by Lambek Categorial Grammars Lambek 1958 .
5476,3,Uncountable and pluralia tantum nouns in denumerated environments are translated as the prepositional complement of a classifier .
5477,3,We modify the function  to handle this :
5478,3,To derive a good approximation to it _comma_ therefore _comma_ we adopt the following algorithm .
5479,3,Two of the main principles of the algorithm are :
5480,3,For instance _comma_ it may be advantageous to weigh those estimates by some measure of the reliability of the similarity metric and of the neighbor distributions .
5481,3,The results of the experiment can be seen in Table  .
5482,5,Very briefly _comma_ this consists of redoing the derivation of each training example top-down by letting the implicit parse tree drive a rule expansion process _comma_ and aborting the expansion of the specialized rule currently being extracted if the current node of the implicit parse tree meets a set of tree-cutting criteria .
5483,4,In conversation _comma_ a person sometimes has to refer to an object that is not previously known to the other participant .
5484,3,The analysis so far has been concerned with control shifts where shifts were identified from a series of rules which related utterance type and control .
5485,2,Purely as a method of estimation as well _comma_ the superiority of MDL over MLE is supported by convincing theoretical findings Barron and Cover 1991 _comma_ Yamanishi 1992 .
5486,3,For the purposes of the expansion algorithm _comma_ a fully inequated feature structure consists of a feature tree ( as before ) and an equivalence relation over all the maximal nodes in that tree .
5487,4,When an agent refers to a particular object that is not previously known to another agent _comma_ she has the intention that the agent be able to identify the object ( when it is possible to do so ) by means of the referring expression .
5488,5,For example _comma_ Hearst and Schuetze 1993 take steps toward a distributional treatment of WordNet-based classes _comma_ using Schuetze 1993 's approach to constructing vector representations from a large co-occurrence matrix .
5489,5,Various methods of quoting accuracy have been used in the literature _comma_ the most common being the proportion of words ( tokens ) receiving the correct tag .
5490,5,postures which are ways to be in a position ( to be standing _comma_ sitting _comma_ lying ) .
5491,2,HMM taggers often perform poorly on unknown words .
5492,3,The similarity represents the strength of lexical cohesion or semantic relation _comma_ and also provides valuable information about similarity and coherence of texts .
5493,5,'' While nominal centering assumes there is one object that the current discourse is `` about _comma_ '' temporal centering assumes that there is one thread that the discourse is currently following _comma_ and that _comma_ in addition to tense and aspect constraints _comma_ there is a preference for a new utterance to continue a thread which has a parallel tense or which is semantically related to it and a preference to continue the current thread rather than switching to another thread .
5494,6,Although hypothetical _comma_ this design and its components are similar to those used in existing database query Rayner and Alshawi 1992 and translation systems Alshawi et al. 1992 .
5495,3,An obvious and trivial case where clustering is likely to be useful is a speech understander for use by travelers in an international airport ; here _comma_ an utterance will typically consist of words from one _comma_ and only one _comma_ natural language _comma_ and clusters for different languages will be totally dissimilar .
5496,3,Consider again the derivation of harry found by type-raising and forward composition .
5497,3,Firstly _comma_ we relax the stipulation that the items on the right hand side of the rules are strings _comma_ allowing them instead to be multisets .
5498,5,Although some of the parses can be ruled out using structural preferences during parsing ( such as Late Closure or Minimal Attachment Frazier 1979 ) _comma_ extraction of the correct set of plausible readings requires use of real world knowledge .
5499,3,Since data can be represented as higher order tuples _comma_ single layer networks can be used .
5500,7,In the next section _comma_ we show how this system applies to several cases of right-node raising .
5501,3,In  _comma_ 's are the records of unification _comma_ that contain the costs and the original types ; they become necessary when they are backtracked _comma_ and in that meaning _comma_ those bindings are transitive .
5502,3,When a sequence contains more than two such PPs _comma_ i.e. _comma_ with anaphors as objects _comma_ the length of a cycle is more than 4 .
5503,5,For comparison _comma_ the evaluation procedure used to evaluate the implementation of the HMM tagger described in the preceding section was repeated without using any of the initial biases .
5504,3,The attachment module has been implemented at 99 % .
5505,3,Although the grammar is very limited _comma_ the use of probabilities in ranking the parser 's output can be seen as a first step towards implementing a principle-based parser using a more fully specified collection of grammar modules .
5506,3,The SEM feature of ``  P-garu / gat-ta '' is the following .
5507,5,In order to compute the intersection of a DCG and a FSA we assume that FSA are represented as before .
5508,3,So _comma_ the hierarchy is accessed during both plan construction and plan inference .
5509,1,Our robust parser with recovery mechanism - extended general algorithm for least-errors recognition - can be easily scaled up and modified because it utilize only syntactic information .
5510,5,Several Japanese linguists have already proposed the general structure of Japanese utterances Mikami 1953 _comma_ Minami 1974 _comma_ Takubo 1987 _comma_ Gunji 1989 .
5511,6,Accounts of various linguistic phenomena have been developed within the framework on which our extension is based _comma_ including quantifiers and anaphora Dalrymple et al. 1994a _comma_ intensional verbs Dalrymple et al. 1994b _comma_ and complex predicates Dalrymple et al. 1993a .
5512,3,Similar to SYSCONJ _comma_ this allows coordination when two conjuncts map between the same pairs of states .
5513,3,describes a complex tense clause and describes a complex tense event _comma_ or
5514,6,We constrain S  in this way because of lack of space ; additional constraints are given in Hitzeman et al. 1994 .
5515,1,This paper presents a method for automatic sense disambiguation of nouns appearing within sets of related nouns -- the kind of data one finds in on-line thesauri _comma_ or as the output of distributional clustering algorithms .
5516,5,It is based on the notion of essential arguments _comma_ arguments which must be instantiated to ensure the efficient and terminating execution of a node .
5517,5,Thus _comma_ referring expressions are represented as plan derivations _comma_ and an unsuccessful referring expression is an invalid plan in whose repair the agents collaborate .
5518,3,To distinguish between multiple paths entering an f-structure _comma_ we now take  to map from sets of paths in f-structures to semantic structures .
5519,3,the Boolean connectives ( true _comma_ false _comma_  _comma_ _comma_ _comma_ etc .
5520,3,Expectations can be used to guide the action interpretation and plan-recognition processes ( as proposed by Carberry 1990 ) _comma_ but expectations do not in and of themselves provide a sufficient motivation for an agent to perform the expected action - in many cases there is nothing wrong with doing the unexpected or not performing an expected action .
5521,5,When the original parsing algorithm terminates unsuccessfully _comma_ the algorithm begins to assume errors of insertion _comma_ deletion and mutation of a word .
5522,3,Consider _comma_ for instance _comma_ the example :
5523,3,The order in which the results are produced will reflect the lexical ordering of the rules as they are converted by LHIP .
5524,2,Although attempts have been made to modify PS grammars / parsers to cope with extragrammatical input Carbonell and Hayes 1983 _comma_ Douglas and Dale 1992 _comma_ Jensen et al. 1983 _comma_ Mellish 1989 _comma_ this is a feature which has to be ` added on ' and tends to affect the statement of the grammar .
5525,5,Not all dialectometrists agree on the wisdom of delineating dialect areas .
5526,3,At  the two copies of are distributed across the daughters .
5527,2,It is left unexplained what goals motivate conversational co-operation .
5528,3,The Penn Treebank parses of the Brown corpus were used to determine whether a token functions as an adnominal modifier .
5529,3,Obligations also cannot be reduced to simple expectations _comma_ although obligations may act as a source of expectations .
5530,3,In our approach we decided to reuse the data which come naturally with a tagger _comma_ viz. the lexicon .
5531,3,This allows us to effectively produce a corpus tagged according to a different scheme without having to manually re-tag the corpus .
5532,3,The case of the tags `` VBN '' and `` PRD '' ( past participles and predicative adjectives ) demonstrates the difficulties of word classes with indistinguishable distributions .
5533,5,Shared Environment Mutual Belief Induction Schema
5534,5,Moreover _comma_ there are now relatively sophisticated ways of packing ambiguities during parsing ( e.g. by the use of graph-structured stacks and packed parse forests Tomita 1985 ) .
5535,3,A similar problem concerns examples such as the following _comma_ from Gibson et al. 1993 .
5536,5,These theories are usually implemented in a language such as Prolog that can simulate  - term operations with first-order unification .
5537,3,Consider the sequence  _comma_ where P _comma_ Q _comma_ R are arbitrary ( blocks of ) sentences .
5538,2,However _comma_ for many tasks _comma_ one is interested in relationships among word senses _comma_ not words .
5539,3,The predicate side _ effect is used to construct the parse forest grammar .
5540,3,Still _comma_ the intuitions underlying that work will help to clarify what an obligation is .
5541,3,This state holds whenever John is at the beach _comma_ recorded by the condition that the location time  of overlaps the event time _comma_ of John 's being at the beach _comma_ in Figure .
5542,3,The last problem is noun phrases whose countability and number can be deduced from information in other sentences .
5543,6,To do this the project applies the method described here .
5544,5,She considers two properties : SUBJ and IDENT .
5545,5,de Swart 1991 offers a solution from a Generalized Quantifier approach _comma_ based on the analysis of quantified NPs in transitive sentences .
5546,5,There seems to be a certain bias in favour of working with lexical correspondences _comma_ which is understandable _comma_ since deciding whether two sites use the same word for the same concept is perhaps one of the easiest linguistic judgements to make .
5547,5,The semantics processor has access to information such as the surface syntactic structure of the utterance .
5548,4,However _comma_ this kind of formalization obviously contradicts the partial / distributed processing that would be required in parallel architecture in future .
5549,3,Before proceeding _comma_ a word of motivation is in order .
5550,3,The ideal grammar denotes the grammar used to generate the training and test data .
5551,6,Following Scha and Polanyi 1988 and Pruest et al. 1994 _comma_ our model of discourse consists of units called Discourse Constituent Units ( DCUs ) which are related by various temporal and rhetorical relations .
5552,3,First _comma_ we wanted to compare the parsing capability of the GLR* parser with that of the original GLR parser .
5553,2,However _comma_ the Shake-and-Bake generation algorithm of Whitelock 1992 is NP-complete .
5554,3,Appendix B gives the details of the spreading activation .
5555,3,In addition to its generality _comma_ a syntactic-head-driven algorithm provides a basis for a logically well-defined treatment of the movement of ( syntactic ) heads _comma_ for which only ad-hoc solutions existed _comma_ so far .
5556,3,To use the PPs that in the corpus are attached to other complements and not to the main verb as a source of `` implicit negative examples '' _comma_ in such a way that they would constrain the over-generalization .
5557,3,To handle an example like third _comma_ we employ a preference for relating a sentence to a thread that has content words that are rated as semantically `` close '' to that of the sentence :
5558,2,Most other class-based modeling techniques for natural language rely instead on `` hard '' Boolean classes Brown et al. 1990 .
5559,3,Our working hypothesis is that syntactic behavior is reflected in co-occurrence patterns .
5560,3,I use the term antecedent to refer to the most recent utterance which should have added the proposition to the context .
5561,2,When using the Xerox tagger with its original guesser _comma_ 63 unknown words were incorrectly tagged and the accuracy on the unknown words was measured at 81.8 % .
5562,3,This use of universal quantification to extract out c from a term containing c in this case gives the same result as a direct implementation of the rule for cooordination of unary functions  would .
5563,7,We will describe the results of this experimentation in this section .
5564,3,But here the parser doesn't even use the information that the words are to come from a lexicon for a particular language .
5565,3,The situation is different in the TODs .
5566,3,In contrast _comma_   is asymmetric in that it weighs each context in proportion to its probability of occurrence with w _comma_ but not with w ' .
5567,2,Specifically _comma_ if a treatment such as Hinrichs 's is used to explain the forward progression of time in example _comma_ then it must be explained why sentence is as felicitous as sentence .
5568,5,A set of rules which on the basis of ending characters of unknown words _comma_ assign them with sets of possible POS - tags is supplied with the Xerox tagger Kupiec 1992 .
5569,4,Information is exchanged by MIXED-INITIATIVE .
5570,5,Now consider processing if Mary left .
5571,5,Douglas Biber has studied text variation along several parameters _comma_ and found that texts can be considered to vary along five dimensions .
5572,1,We propose a method to analyze Japanese compound nouns using collocational information and a thesaurus .
5573,4,If the language is very highly inflected _comma_ it may be be possible to do all ( or a large part ) of the work of a tagger with a word-by-word morphological analysis instead .
5574,3,Making an assumption can be influenced by global constraints .
5575,3,However _comma_ the implementation issues _comma_ although more complex _comma_ are also well-understood and it can be expected that future work will bring further improvements .
5576,3,Next we talk about the semantics of garu .
5577,3,As long as readability indexing schemes are used in descriptive applications they work well to discriminate between text types .
5578,5,In her theory _comma_ since the both of zero subjects share the subjecthood _comma_ both of them finally are known to refer to Hanako that is the topic for both of these clauses .
5579,3,The TODs are about the construction of a plastic water pump in both telephone and keyboard modality .
5580,5,In Hindle 's proposal _comma_ words are similar if we have strong statistical evidence that they tend to participate in the same events .
5581,1,We model mixed-initiative using an utterance type classification and a set of rules for transfer of control between discourse participants that were proposed by Whittaker and Stenton 1988 .
5582,3,We will freely use the usual tree terminology such as mother-of _comma_ daughter-of _comma_ dominates _comma_ and so on .
5583,7,In the beginning of the section _comma_ the basic design of the system is outlined .
5584,3,The method was systematically evaluated on the Brown corpus .
5585,3,Then we redistribute that mass to unseen cooccurrences according to an averaged cooccurrence distribution of a set of most similar conditioning words _comma_ using relative entropy as our similarity measure .
5586,3,The empty constituent is reconstructed by copying the embedded sentence from the source to the target clause _comma_ along with parallel trace assumptions which are to be bound within the target .
5587,4,For example _comma_ Hirschberg 1985 has shown that in order to understand a scalar implicature _comma_ one must analyze the conversants ' beliefs and intentions .
5588,5,Temporal connectives are viewed as relations _comma_ TC _comma_ between two sets of events :
5589,3,A partially instantiated QLF therefore effectively specifies a set of possible evaluations ( or semantic compositions ) .
5590,3,be a witnessing derivable sequent _comma_ i.e. _comma_ for  _comma_ .
5591,3,The second is to provide a basis for a semantic representation .
5592,3,For each possible structure of a compound noun _comma_ the preference is calculated based on this collocational information and the structure with the highest score wins .
5593,7,In Section  _comma_ we show how this proposal accounts for the data presented in Section .
5594,2,However _comma_ in practice _comma_ the more the level of depth of recursively appearing ` Comment ' is _comma_ the less comprehensible the sentence is .
5595,3,( In this respect they are reminiscent of the feature specification defaults of GPSG. )
5596,5,Perhaps the most obvious measure of the similarity between two sentences or clusters is then Jaccard 's coefficient Everitt 1993 _comma_ the ratio of the number of words occurring in both sentences to the number occurring in either or both .
5597,5,Given a logic program _comma_ Magic produces a new program in which the filtering as normally resulting from top-down evaluation is explicitly characterized through _comma_ so-called _comma_ magic predicates _comma_ which produce variable bindings for filtering when evaluated bottom-up .
5598,5,a cognizer that corresponds to our observer is introduced if garu is used _comma_ and
5599,5,The following UDRS represents simultaneously the two readings of the sentence ` every woman loves a man ' by leaving the exact structural embedding of the quantified phrases underspecified .
5600,3,The approach allows efficient bidirectional processing with similar generation and parsing times .
5601,3,for some interpretation I and some object u in I _comma_ F is true of u under I .
5602,3,affirm that the plan was expanded with the suggestion by using the s-affirm speech act ;
5603,3,The Narration relation orders the times in forward progression in passage  and the Explanation relation orders them in backward progression in passage .
5604,4,Describing objects is one of several purposes for which linguists use feature structures .
5605,4,Unification-based grammar formalisms can be viewed as generalizations of Context-Free Grammars ( CFG ) where the nonterminal symbols are replaced by an infinite domain of feature structures .
5606,3,Definition 1 .
5607,5,This method _comma_ by its nature _comma_ has no problem handling rare words .
5608,4,Compilation to a network may still make sense _comma_ however _comma_ and because these languages tend to exhibit few non-concatenative morphophonological phenomena other than vowel harmony _comma_ the continuation class mechanism may suffice to describe the allowed affix sequences at the surface level .
5609,5,Thus _comma_ the auxiliary verbs be _comma_ do and have have the same tags as other verbs in Penn _comma_ but are each separated out in the LOB tagset .
5610,3,Parsing of sentences is achieved by starting in a state expecting a sentence _comma_ and applying the rules non-deterministically as each word is input .
5611,3,There are two unusual features .
5612,3,In our work we do not modify the corresponding source lexicon but we employ our finite-state calculus to map the lexical transducer into a new one .
5613,5,The result of the initiator 's plan is a set of surface speech actions _comma_ and hearing only these actions _comma_ the recipient tries to infer a plan in order to understand the reference .
5614,5,In a previous paper Schuetze 1993 _comma_ we trained a neural network to disambiguate part-of-speech using context ; however _comma_ no information about the word that is to be categorized was used .
5615,1,We describe a corpus-based induction algorithm for probabilistic context-free grammars .
5616,3,The parser was applied to two different domains _comma_ IBM Computer Manuals and the Wall Street Journal .
5617,3,This behaviour cannot be captured whether we adopt a bottom-up or a top-down search for tree-lowering .
5618,3,Analysis of case in which a directional auxiliary verb i.e. ` yaru ' _comma_ ` kureru ' is used is left as the future problem .
5619,5,Solomonoff 1964 presents a Bayes -ian grammar induction framework that includes such a factor in a motivated manner .
5620,7,The next section describes the binary representation and the length formul derived from it in detail ; readers satisfied with the intuitive descriptions presented so far should skip ahead to the Phonotactics sub-section .
5621,5,Recognition for such ` off-line parsable ' grammars is decidable Pereira and Warren 1983 .
5622,1,We have defined a variant of Lambek 's original calculus of types that allows abstracted-over categories to freely permute .
5623,3,We maintain a single hypothesis grammar which is initialized to a small _comma_ trivial grammar .
5624,2,That is _comma_ one would predict a clash of temporal relations for sentence  _comma_ since the simple pasts induce the forward progression of time but the conjunction indicates the reverse temporal ordering .
5625,5,The Grosz et al. 1986 centering model is based on the following assumptions .
5626,3,Then it is straightforward to show that  .
5627,3,The tag set used to annotate the English text is a slightly modified version of the Brown tag set _comma_ consisting of a total of 72 tags .
5628,3,To illustrate its operation _comma_ consider the following discourse :
5629,3,The algorithm employs a greedy heuristic search within a Bayes -ian framework _comma_ and a post-pass using the Inside-Outside algorithm .
5630,4,A machine translation system needs to have this knowledge codified in some way .
5631,4,Discharging the hypothesis _comma_ indicated by index 1 _comma_ results in Bill misses being analyzed as an s / np from zero hypotheses .
5632,6,It is part of a discourse grammar implemented in Carpenter 's ALE formalism .
5633,2,Little work has been done on the complexity of algorithms used to parse with a principle-based grammar _comma_ since such grammars do not exist as accepted mathematically well-defined constructs .
5634,3,Next consider the definite clause specification of a FSA .
5635,3,This might be a likely state for say a head final language _comma_ but an unlikely state for a language such as English .
5636,5,Such techniques might be of use both in the case of written and spoken language input .
5637,3,In this paper _comma_ the rhetorical structure is represented by two layers : intra-paragraph and inter-paragraph structures .
5638,3,These constituted just 10.6 % of the test sample _comma_ leading to an overall reduction in test-set perplexity of 2.4 % .
5639,3,The verb sortir-to go out implicitly suggests an initial location ; the preposition dans - ( which means in _comma_ but which is translated here by into ) is a positional preposition and _comma_ as so _comma_ only denotes the static spatial relation inside .
5640,5,For example _comma_ in parsing _comma_
5641,3,It seems likely therefore that some of our findings ( e.g the central shift ) will be specific to the diagnostic dialogues we studied .
5642,3,R to
5643,3,3 RD PERSON :
5644,5,This section examines the assumption from the DETERMINISTIC MODEL that :  Propositions representing beliefs and intentions get added to the context by the unilateral action of one conversant .
5645,3,Guessing based on endings offers some side advantages : unknown words often result from alternations _comma_ which occur at the beginning of the word _comma_ the rest remaining the same _comma_ e.g. derivational prefixes as in isralo-jordano-palestinienne but also oral transcriptions such as les z 'oreilles ( the ears ) _comma_ with z ' marking the phonological liaison .
5646,3,We then define the SDL-grammar  as follows :
5647,3,There are hardly any distributional clues for distinguishing `` VBN '' and `` PRD '' since both are mainly used as complements of `` to be '' .
5648,3,Consider the following possible continuations of  :
5649,3,readings for ambigous words with probabilities _comma_ possibly assigned by a stochastic tagger Brew 1993 .
5650,5,More recently _comma_ Cutting et al. 1992 suggest that training can be achieved with a minimal lexicon and a limited amount of a priori information about probabilities _comma_ by using Baum-Welch re-estimation to automatically refine the model .
5651,2,Second _comma_ without additional constraints _comma_ Dalrymple et al. slightly overgenerate readings for sentences like
5652,1,Our computational model can therefore be viewed as the first serious attempt at a comprehensive computational model that produces adequate argumentative texts from ND style proofs .
5653,5,For the phrase-structure tree rooted with s _comma_ there is no leaf which would fulfill the definition of a semantic head given in Shieber et al. 1990 or van Noord 1993 .
5654,3,how the representation and mapping are acquired by human .
5655,1,What we aim in this paper is to propose a paradigm that enables partial / local generation through decompositions and reorganizations of tentative local structures .
5656,4,For an introduction to the algorithms _comma_ see Cutting et al. 1992 _comma_ or the lucid description by Sharman 1990 .
5657,3,It is often the case that from this interaction appear new properties that belong neither to the verb or the preposition .
5658,3,Needless to say _comma_ the most important task that faces this third response is to get on with the business of writing grammars ; that _comma_ and nothing else _comma_ is the acid test .
5659,3,The agent constructs an initial referring expression plan in almost the same way as in Heeman and Hirst 's system .
5660,3,We expect that these measures would increase the efficiency of LHIP .
5661,3,The first is to provide syntactic information which guides how the rest of the sentence can be integrated into the tree .
5662,3,This can be repeated an unbounded number of times so that all full binary trees are produced .
5663,3,We consider these models within the context of two hypothetical speech translation systems _comma_ starting with a logic-based design and pointing out which of its characteristics are best preserved or eliminated in moving to the second _comma_ quantitative design .
5664,3,The code for coordination is shown in Figure  .
5665,4,One important and necessary task to be done _comma_ when a parser processes a discourse in Japanese _comma_ is the so called zero anaphora resolution .
5666,2,However _comma_ there is often a trade-off between run-time efficiency and factors important for rapid and accurate system development _comma_ such as perspicuity of notation _comma_ ease of debugging _comma_ speed of compilation and the size of its output _comma_ and the independence of the morphological and lexical components .
5667,3,Using this algorithm _comma_ we can precisely identify the rhetorical and temporal relations when cue words to rhetorical structure are present _comma_ as in  :
5668,4,However _comma_ even if we fix both syntactic category and lexical meaning _comma_ we still get some weird coordinations .
5669,4,The ontology underlying LFG is a composite one _comma_ consisting of trees _comma_ feature structures and links between the two .
5670,4,Collaborative agents are interested in others ' beliefs in order to decide whether to revise their own beliefs so as to come to agreement Chu-Carroll and Carberry 1995 .
5671,3,This would allow one measure of the ( linguistic ) feasibility of cooperative error processing : the effectiveness of shallow processing over errors revealed by the keystroke-record data .
5672,3,The distinction between planned and unplanned behavior enables a very natural segmentation of the discourse into an attentional hierarchy .
5673,3,The input to the learning process is a list of co-occurrence triples codifying the co-occurrence of verbs and complement heads in the corpus : ( verb _comma_ syntactic relationship _comma_ noun ) .
5674,3,This structure is also represented as follows :
5675,4,French has a little more complexity _comma_ with gender _comma_ number and person marked _comma_ while Swedish has more detailed marking for gender _comma_ number _comma_ definiteness and case .
5676,3,The learning is implemented as a two-staged process with feedback .
5677,3,Responsibility for any remaining errors or unclarities rests in the customary place .
5678,1,This paper describes a fully automated hybrid system _comma_ using neural nets operating within a grammatic framework .
5679,5,To begin _comma_ we assume every link has a constant length of 1 .
5680,6,Following Kamp and Reyle 1993 _comma_ we split the role of the reference time _comma_ used to account for a large array of phenomena _comma_ into several independent mechanisms .
5681,3,This means _comma_ for example _comma_ that the applicability of the productions used on the path from the root of  to the root of depends on the feature f in having the value a but does not depend on the value of the feature g in .
5682,3,As far as we know these are the most detailed of their type _comma_ and the ones which are most likely to be able to exploit standard training and parsing algorithms .
5683,5,The algorithm in Shieber et al. 1990 relaxes this condition .
5684,4,Categorial Grammar ( CG ) and in particular Lambek Categorial Grammar ( LCG ) have their well-known benefits for the formal treatment of natural language syntax and semantics .
5685,3,For this _comma_ first of all _comma_ we introduce a new pragmatic role called observer .
5686,3,Thus _comma_ even though we now use the same parser for an infinite set of input sentences ( represented by the FSA ) the parser still is able to come up with a parse forest grammar .
5687,2,If we employ MLE as criterion in our simulated annealing algorithm _comma_ it will result in selecting a very fine model with many small clusters _comma_ most of which will have probabilities estimated as zero .
5688,5,Elman 1990 trains a connectionist net to predict words _comma_ a process that generates internal representations that reflect grammatical category .
5689,3,and closed-class vs. adjective vs. adverb ( round _comma_ next ) _comma_
5690,4,A plausible assumption on the dependencies between random variables is intuitively that each variable directly depends on at most one other variable .
5691,3,Secondly _comma_ training from a hand-tagged corpus ( case D0+T0 ) always does best _comma_ even when the test data is from a different source to the training data _comma_ as it is for LOB-L .
5692,4,In  _comma_ the pronoun he is bound by the quantifier every boy .
5693,5,Babitch 1988 described the dialectal distances in Acadian villages by the degree to which their fishing terminology varied .
5694,3,The third strategy is both simpler and more speculative .
5695,5,A string of words is a sentence if it has the type _comma_ c  c where c and c are appropriate initial and final states for a parse .
5696,3,where * means don't care .
5697,2,When the Xerox tagger was equipped with our cascading guesser its accuracy on unknown words increased by almost 9 % upto 90.5 % .
5698,3,One reason why agents need EVIDENCE for beliefs is that they only have partial information about :
5699,3,That the utterance will have the intended effect is only a hypothesis at the point where the utterance has just been made _comma_ irrespective of the intentions of the speaker .
5700,3,If the listener believes that an assertion about the proposed plan is ambiguous _comma_ then interrupt .
5701,3,We then went on to analyse how control was exchanged between participants at the boundaries of these phases .
5702,3,For instance _comma_ if passage  was uttered in response to the question
5703,5,Because this algorithm is also syntactically oriented and based on a chart _comma_ it has the same advantage as that of Mellish 's parser .
5704,5,In the examples discussed in Dalrymple et al. 1993b there is a one-to-one correspondence between the set of path sets S and the set of f-structures picked out by such path sets _comma_ so the two methods yield the same predictions for those cases .
5705,3,We present a set of examples that covers a representative group of pragmatic inferences .
5706,3,Furthermore _comma_ examining the accuracies in table  _comma_ in the cases of initial maximum and early maximum _comma_ the accuracy tends to be significantly higher than with classical behaviour .
5707,3,There are several measures of correctness that can be taken when results are evaluated .
5708,3,This analysis gives us some indication of the contribution of syntactic constraints _comma_ task structure and global focus to anaphoric processing .
5709,3,Many of these triples ( 68_comma_800 _comma_ 36.1 % ) were discarded before the lemmatizing process because the surface NP head wasn't a noun .
5710,5,Recall  _comma_ repeated below :
5711,5,Use of Reference Networks
5712,1,That is _comma_ our first task will be to give a precise -- and transparent -- mathematical picture of the LFG ontology .
5713,5,A rule-based tagger described in Voutilainen 1995 is equipped with a set of guessing rules which has been hand-crafted using knowledge of English morphology and intuition .
5714,4,Parsing uncertain input might be necessary in case of ill-formed textual input _comma_ or in case of speech input .
5715,3,The best parameter values found were k = 60 _comma_ t = 2.5 _comma_  and .
5716,2,( The models selected by MDL converge to the true model approximately at the rate of 1 / s where s is the number of parameters in the true model _comma_ whereas for MLE the rate is 1 / t _comma_ where t is the size of the domain _comma_ or in our context _comma_ the total number of elements of  . )
5717,3,The corpus likelihood is then  _comma_ and the per-word entropy _comma_ _comma_ is thus minimized .
5718,3,We will discuss the reasons which lead us to use these linguistic facts and present several directions to improve the system 's classification performance .
5719,1,In this paper _comma_ we present a bottom-up variant of Earley deduction _comma_ which we find advantageous for the following reasons :
5720,3,The use of linear logic provides a flexible mechanism for deducing meanings of sentences based on their f-structure representations .
5721,3,Class guessers for the Xerox tagger assign potential POS tags to unknown words according to a surface analysis of the word form .
5722,3,We claim that natural languages can be considered as a trace of these representations _comma_ in which it is possible _comma_ with systematic and detailled linguistic studies _comma_ to light up the way spatiotemporal properties are represented and on which basic concepts these representations lie .
5723,3,Each feature structure is a connected Moore machine Moore 1965 with finitely many states _comma_ input alphabet _comma_ and output alphabet .
5724,1,In this paper _comma_ we attempt to quantify the usefulness of distribution and phonotactics in segmenting speech .
5725,3,The system is being improved by identifying groups of words that act as single lexical items .
5726,3,I call members of  states _comma_ members of types _comma_ subsumption _comma_ members of species _comma_ members of attributes _comma_ and appropriateness .
5727,3,However we use semantic role like `` agent '' _comma_ `` patient '' _comma_ `` experiencer '' _comma_ and so on _comma_ as argument roles of soa .
5728,3,the inside ;
5729,5,Unfolding can be used to eliminate superfluous filtering steps .
5730,3,In particular _comma_ much of local discourse behavior can arise in a `` reactive manner '' without the need for complex planning .
5731,3,A general trend of rising accuracy on each iteration _comma_ with any falls in accuracy being local .
5732,3,Passing the right subtrees ( x _comma_ y _comma_ x ' and y ' ) to the mother as shown allows the construction of a full binary tree with height i + 1 (  ) .
5733,5,Typically there is a many-one mapping from compositions onto meanings .
5734,3,When  assumes a word-class or ` 0 ' as its value _comma_ the corresponding model is called a ` class-based model '.
5735,3,As for the technical papers _comma_ the average length ratio ( abstract / original ) was 24 % _comma_ and the coverage of the key sentence and the most important key sentence were 51 % and 74 % respectively .
5736,5,The Xerox tagger attempts to avoid the need for a hand-tagged training corpus as far as possible .
5737,7,The way generic noun phrases are expressed in English is described in Section  .
5738,3,More and more of Biber 's features will be available with the advent of more proficient analysis programs _comma_ for instance if complete surface syntactic parsing were performed before categorization Voutilainen and Tapanainen 1993 .
5739,3,Goals and clauses are associated with preference values that are intended to model the degree of confidence that a particular solution is the ` correct ' one .
5740,2,The hypotheses in figure  seem completely plausible _comma_ but the relationship of cognitive effort to dialogue behavior has never been explored .
5741,3,For instance _comma_ the symbol + Verb is transformed into + VERB-P 3 SG if the immediate left context consists of the symbols + SG + P 3 .
5742,3,Little human effort on knowledge engineering is required .
5743,3,The anaphora procedure skips the resolution of a given anaphor when this anaphor is preceded by an unattached preposition .
5744,3,closed-class vs. adjective ( numeral un ) .
5745,3,Better _comma_ perhaps _comma_ would be to draw on what is good in LFG and to explore the logical options that arise naturally when the model theoretic view is taken as primary .
5746,3,The drawback is the complexity it introduces into an ( up till now ) quite simple story .
5747,1,We describe and experimentally evaluate a method for automatically clustering words according to their distribution in particular syntactic contexts .
5748,3,The operational semantics for  -Prolog state that is provable if and only if [ c / x ] G is provable _comma_ where c is a new variable of the same type as x that does not otherwise occur in the current signature .
5749,4,The calculation of the intersection of a CFG and a FSA is very simple Bar-Hillel et al. 1961 .
5750,3,Similarly _comma_ spelling errors which account for many of the unknown words actually affect the ending less than the internal structure of the word _comma_ e.g. the misspelt verb forms appellaient _comma_ geulait .
5751,3,The two reasons for missing information necessitate different methods of treatment which nevertheless both can uniformly be integrated into regular processing .
5752,5,If a speaker has a number of propositions to express _comma_ one very simple way to do this coherently is to express all the propositions about a given entity ( continuing ) before introducing a related entity ( retaining ) and then shifting the center to this new entity .
5753,5,For example _comma_ cutting up the first parse tree of Figure  at the NP of the rule vp_v_np yields rules 2 and 3 of Figure .
5754,5,The ordering of anaphors and their antecedents is often used informally to justify left-to-right threading or threading through semantic structure .
5755,5,the probability that  is followed by the same context words as .
5756,1,Our aim is to formalize constraints that are needed to develop a parser based on unification grammar ( called `` UG '' henceforth ) so that our parser can deal with variety of types of sentences in Japanese .
5757,3,We have also described two forms of discourse inference _comma_ namely Common Topic inference and Coherent Situation inference .
5758,3,for ) .
5759,6,However _comma_ following Bernard Lang we argue that it might be fruitful to take the input more generally as a finite state automaton ( FSA ) to model cases in which we are uncertain about the actual input .
5760,4,The search space is taken to be some class of grammars ; for example _comma_ in our work we search within the space of probabilistic context-free grammars .
5761,3,And both nodes of the BothNucleus relations are equivalent in their importance .
5762,5,Based on explicit communicative knowledge encoded as schemata _comma_ hierarchical planning splits a presentation task into subtasks .
5763,3,While the tree sets of LIG and Tree Adjoining Grammars have independent branches _comma_ PLTG tree sets exhibit dependent branches _comma_ where the number of dependent branches in any tree is bounded by the grammar .
5764,6,We have a lexical transducer for French Karttunen et al. 1992 which was built using Xerox Lexical Tools Karttunen and Beesley 1992 _comma_ Karttunen 1993 .
5765,3,In making a reference _comma_ an agent uses the most salient attributes of the referent .
5766,5,For example _comma_ interruptions can be used for early signalling of errors and ambiguities .
5767,3,As we shall see in the next section _comma_ the notion of validity has an important role to play in grammar specification .
5768,3,It 's worth remarking that this second response is not incompatible with the first ; it is common to provide programming languages with both a denotational and an operational semantics .
5769,3,Thus we are mostly interested in how the advantage of one rule-set over another will affect the tagging performance .
5770,3,Second _comma_ each modification of an object 's state makes it compare new and old information .
5771,5,The first is the problem of parsing continuous speech into words given a developed lexicon to which incoming sounds can be matched ; both psychologists Cutler and Carter 1987 _comma_ Cutler and Butterfield 1992 and designers of speech-recognition systems Church 1987 have examined this problem .
5772,2,However _comma_ the problem we examined is different -- we want to know how infants segment speech before knowing which phonemic sequences form words .
5773,3,all Boolean combinations of wffs are wffs _comma_
5774,3,Secondly _comma_ the error analysis suggests that considering non-local dependencies would improve results .
5775,3,The logic fits well with the ` resource-sensitivity ' of natural language semantics : there is a one-to-one correspondence between f-structure relationships and meanings ; the multiple use of resources arises from multiple paths to them in the f-structure .
5776,3,The subset contains 2_comma_658 examples of four average common verbs in the Treebank : rise _comma_ report _comma_ seek and present ( from now on _comma_ the testing sample ) .
5777,4,In a straightforward approach this would also lead to a finite-state automaton with cycles .
5778,1,We attempt to evaluate two different approaches to anaphoric processing in discourse by comparing the accuracy and coverage of two published algorithms for finding the co-specifiers of pronouns in naturally occurring texts and dialogues Hobbs 1976b _comma_ Brennan et al. 1987 .
5779,3,The direct evaluation of the rule-sets gave us the grounds for the comparison and selection of the best performing guessing rule-sets .
5780,3,It is the choice of this particular transition at this point which allows verb phrase modification _comma_ and hence _comma_ assuming the next word is Sue _comma_ an implicit bracketing of the string fragment as ( John ( likes Sue ) ) .
5781,3,In our experiments we used the lexicon and word-frequencies derived from the Brown Corpus Francis and Kucera 1982 .
5782,7,In Section  below _comma_ I report results of such experiments with ATIS data _comma_ which _comma_ for the reasons given above _comma_ would at first sight seem relatively unlikely to yield useful results from a clustering approach .
5783,4,Lexical entries specify syntactic constraints on f-structures as well as semantic information :
5784,4,A DCG is a simple example of a family of constraint-based grammar formalisms that are widely used in natural language analysis ( and generation ) .
5785,3,Countable indefinite plural noun phrases and uncountable noun phrases may have some generated ; a full discussion of this is outside the scope of this article .
5786,3,Perhaps the major factor we have to set against this is the danger of introducing more human errors into the manual tagging process _comma_ by increasing the cognitive load on the human annotators .
5787,6,The syntactic generator VM-GEN is a further development of TAG-GEN Kilger 1994 within the framework of VERBMOBIL _comma_ aspeech-to-speech translation system .
5788,3,Each attribute denotes a partial function from the objects in I to the objects in I _comma_ and A assigns each attribute the partial function it denotes .
5789,3,We now turn to an extension of the system which takes proper account of re-entrancies in the structure .
5790,3,It can be shown that the computation of the intersection of a FSA and a CFG requires only a minimal generalization of existing parsing algorithms .
5791,1,It is claimed that a variety of facts concerning ellipsis _comma_ event reference _comma_ and interclausal coherence can be explained by two features of the linguistic form in question :
5792,5,Instead _comma_ each word is modeled by its own specific class _comma_ a set of words which are most similar to it ( as in k-nearest neighbor approaches in pattern recognition ) .
5793,3,do = set  .
5794,5,The Xerox experiments Cutting et al. 1992 correspond to something between D1 and D2 _comma_ and between T0 and T1 _comma_ in that there is some initial biasing of the probabilities .
5795,3,Therefore we can read off the solution to  from this sequent by including in ( for ) those three for which has an occurrence of _comma_ say these are _comma_ and .
5796,2,While the reading generated by Partee and Rooth is derivable _comma_ it requires three quantifiers and thus uses QNP duplication twice _comma_ which is less preferred than the reading requiring two quantifiers which uses QNP duplication once .
5797,7,In the section that follows we outline two types of discourse inference _comma_ one of which requires such restoration of empty constituents .
5798,3,I wish to thank Manny Rayner of SRI International _comma_ Cambridge _comma_ for help and support in matters pertaining to the treebank _comma_ and for enlightening discussions of the scheme as a whole .
5799,3,Let us build such a language .
5800,3,In the case of early maximum _comma_ the few iterations where the accuracy is improving correspond to the creation of entries for unknown words and the fine tuning of ones for known ones _comma_ and these changes outweigh those produced by the re-estimation .
5801,3,The top most frequent equivalence classes for the three languages are listed in table  together with their relative frequencies .
5802,3,The results for the three languages turn out to be quite different _comma_ and the general conclusion ( which is the overall contribution of the paper ) will be that the external criterion should be the one to dominate tagset design : there is a limit to how knowledge-free we can be .
5803,3,Each morph is the Moshier abstraction Moshier 1988 of a connected and totally well-typed Carpenter 1992 Moore machine with possibly infinitely many states _comma_ input alphabet _comma_ and output alphabet .
5804,5,These theories are usually implemented in a language such as Prolog that can simulate  - term operations with first-order unification .
5805,4,Thus _comma_ for this example _comma_ any substring of the sentence can form a viable conjunct .
5806,3,Classes of Anaphors .
5807,7,We conclude this paper with the following remarks .
5808,3,TEMP_EXPR_RELNS : Stores the semantic interpretation of temporal expressions associated with this DCU .
5809,3,This state is a result of the event e _comma_ in which Mary met the president .
5810,5,is called X .
5811,3,The lexicon is identical to that for a standard AACG _comma_ except for having h-lists which are always set to empty .
5812,3,Preference calculation :
5813,1,I discuss two filter optimizations .
5814,3,TENASP : Keeps track of the tense and syntactic aspect of the DCU ( if the DCU is simple ) .
5815,5,In contrast _comma_ statistical techniques using lexeme co-occurrence provide a relatively simple mechanism which can imitate semantic filtering in many cases .
5816,1,The pattern matching capabilities of neural networks can be used to detect syntactic constituents of natural language .
5817,3,We expect that this would help the system find word boundaries for reasons detailed in Church 1987 -- in brief _comma_ that allophonic variation may be quite useful in predicting word boundaries .
5818,3,The implementation of this research can be divided in two parts : sentence tokenization and language classification .
5819,3,Out of 5_comma_970 words of the text _comma_ 2_comma_215 were unknown to the small lexicon .
5820,3,The logical forms are filtered by contextual and word-sense constraints _comma_ and one of them is passed to the translation component .
5821,1,Our aim is to take a set of texts that has been selected by some sort of crude semantic analysis such as is typically performed by an information retrieval system and partition it further by genre or text type _comma_ and to display this variation as simply as possible in one or two dimensions .
5822,3,Generation from Underspecified DRS 's means that sentences can be generated from meaning representations which have not been disambiguated with regard to quantifier scope .
5823,4,Tree  shows a LIG derivation of the substring from the object .
5824,3,Definition 25 .
5825,3,The rules governing tense are :
5826,3,All other words were considered as unknown and had to be guessed by the guessers .
5827,3,This is conjectured to be an effect of the reduction lengths being far too short .
5828,3,In each case _comma_ the best accuracy ( on ambiguous words _comma_ as usual ) from the FB algorithm was noted .
5829,3,But agents can decide whether as well as how to revise their beliefs Galliers 1991 .
5830,3,The analyses presented in this paper start from the following observations _comma_ most of which are fairly orthodox :
5831,3,The algorithm is parametrized with respect to the relation lookup/2 and the choice of the indexing scheme _comma_ which are specific for different grammatical theories and directions of processing .
5832,3,Gold developed his theory for formal languages : it is argued that similar considerations apply here .
5833,4,These examples are analogous with the gapping cases in that constraints against mismatches of syntactic form hold for the symmetric ( i.e. _comma_ parallel ) use of and in examples  and _comma_ but not the asymmetric ( i.e. _comma_ non-parallel ) meaning in examples and .
5834,1,In order to take steps towards establishing a methodology for evaluating Natural Language systems _comma_ we conducted a case study .
5835,3,Highest accuracy on the first iteration _comma_ and falling thereafter .
5836,3,Much of the work in this paper depends on replacing human decision-making skills with automatic decision-making algorithms .
5837,3,This is useful in checking over - and undergeneration .
5838,3,Utterance  realizes _comma_ utterance realizes _comma_ and utterance makes the inference explicit that is given in for the particular tax year of 1981 .
5839,3,This _comma_ however _comma_ by no means restricts the described technique to that or any other tag-set _comma_ lexicon or corpus .
5840,3,This simply says that it is not the case that there is a past stealing event involving me and it .
5841,3,In our analysis we argued for hierarchical organization of the control segments on the basis of specific examples of interruptions .
5842,3,Each row shows : the type of diagnostic _comma_ the number and percentage of classes that accomplish it _comma_ and the number and percentage of noun occurrences contained by these classes in the testing sample .
5843,5,For example _comma_ Lascarides and Asher 1991 suggest that general knowledge postulates ( in the case of : that a pushing can cause a falling ) can be invoked to generate the backward movement reading .
5844,3,In understanding a reference _comma_ an agent determines his confidence in its adequacy as a means of identifying the referent .
5845,3,Slightly more generally _comma_ PLIG can generate the language
5846,2,More specifically _comma_ 'magic generation ' falls prey to non-termination in the face of head recursion _comma_ i.e. _comma_ the generation analog of left recursion in parsing .
5847,4,Deliberation is the process by which an agent decides what to believe and what to do Galliers 1991 _comma_ Doyle 1992 .
5848,6,Our lexicon is based on a finite-state transducer lexicon Karttunen et al. 1992 .
5849,5,Loosely speaking _comma_ the resolvants of a feature structure have the same underlying finite state automaton as the feature structure _comma_ and differ only in their output function .
5850,3,Finally _comma_ we need to deal with the case where  is non-maximal .
5851,5,( Note that under the independence assumption the number of parameters in a slot-based model becomes O(n) . )
5852,3,Currently _comma_ also _comma_ results are returned in an order determined by the order of rules in the grammar .
5853,7,This section deals with morphosyntactic errors which are independent of the two-level analysis .
5854,3,One of the reasons for the computational success of unification-based syntactic formalisms is the order-independence of parser / generator operations they permit .
5855,5,In Pereira et al. 1993 _comma_ they proposed a method of ` soft clustering _comma_ ' namely _comma_ each word can belong to a number of distinct classes with certain probabilities .
5856,4,All of the `` knowledge engineering '' is localised in the choice of tagset and the method of training .
5857,3,The hierarchy whose ALE syntax is given in figure  is captured in the new notation by figure .
5858,3,The first type is when guessers provided broader POS - classes for unknown words and the tagger had difficulties with the disambiguation of such broader classes .
5859,5,In Kehler 1993b _comma_ we presented an analysis of VP-ellipsis that distinguished between two types of relationship between clauses _comma_ parallel and non-parallel .
5860,3,was kept constant .
5861,5,To initiate the process _comma_ speaker A presents an initial version of a referring expression on which speaker B passes judgment .
5862,6,The French description was originally built by Annie Zaenen and Carol Neidle _comma_ and later refined by Chanod 1994 .
5863,2,The resulting account does not suffer from overgeneration inherent in other approaches _comma_ and applies equally to cases of resource sharing that do not involve coordination .
5864,1,This paper describes a formalism that is more powerful than LIG _comma_ but which can also be processed in polynomial time using similar techniques .
5865,4,A robust parser is one that can analyze these extragrammatical sentences without failure .
5866,1,In this paper _comma_ I create an explicit interpretation of a typed feature structure used as a description _comma_ define the notion of a satisfiable feature structure _comma_ and create a simple and effective algorithm to decide if a feature structure is satisfiable .
5867,5,This approach is exemplified by Combinatory Categorial Grammar _comma_ CCG Steedman 1991 _comma_ which takes a basic CG with just application _comma_ and adds various new ways of combining elements together .
5868,3,As for lhip_phrase / 2 _comma_ except that B binds to the beginning of the island described by this application of C _comma_ E binds to the position immediately following the end _comma_ and Cov binds to the number of terminals covered .
5869,4,Filter optimization often comprises an extension of a specific processing strategy such that it exploits specific knowledge about grammars and / or the computational task ( s ) that one is using them for .
5870,4,As an example _comma_ one of the most common errors made by taggers with the LOB and Brown tagsets is mistagging a word as a subordinating conjunction ( CS ) rather than a preposition ( IN ) _comma_ or vice-versa Macklovitch 1992 .
5871,2,At the cost of the complete robustness _comma_ however _comma_ this algorithm degrades the efficiency of parsing _comma_ and generates many intermediate edges .
5872,3,The sequential order of the input is captured here _comma_ partially _comma_ by taking adjacent tags _comma_ pairs and triples _comma_ as the feature elements .
5873,3,for each feature structure  _comma_ set and .
5874,3,Because the TOD 's embody the master-slave assumption Grosz and Sidner 1990 _comma_ and control is allocated to the expert _comma_ our expectation is that control should be located exclusively with one participant in the TODs in contrast with the ADs .
5875,3,the task of the linguist is to explain _comma_ in terms of the relations that exist within a single model _comma_ what grammatical structure is .
5876,5,Both of the taggers come with data and word-guessing components pre-trained on the Brown Corpus .
5877,3,Then a neural net selects the string with the correct placement .
5878,5,The qualitative-quantitative distinction can also be seen as underlying the difference between classification systems based on feature specifications _comma_ as used in unification formalisms Shieber 1986 _comma_ and clustering based on a variable degree of granularity Pereira et al. 1993 .
5879,1,The main aim is to show how existing text planning techniques can be adapted for this particular application .
5880,3,Our use of lexical functions as an interlingua assumes that the relevant aspects of the meaning of the collocate are fully captured by the LF .
5881,3,However _comma_ other experimental results suggest that distance vectors contain some different semantic information from co-occurrence vectors .
5882,3,We illustrate the general difficulties encountered with quantitative evaluation .
5883,4,The concentration in early literature on using incremental interpretation for semantic filtering has perhaps distracted from some other applications which provide less controversial applications .
5884,5,For example _comma_ from the following ` antecedent ' sentence _comma_
5885,3,Step 3 .
5886,5,This model consists of a number of simplifying assumptions such as :
5887,3,This result indicates that efficient parsing for grammars that allow for large numbers of unbounded dependencies from within one node may be problematic _comma_ even in the categorial framework .
5888,4,Defining dialects is one of the first tasks that linguists need to pursue when approaching a language .
5889,3,At this experiment we obtained similar metrics apart from the coverage which dropped about 0.5 % for Ending 75 and Xerox rule-sets and 7 % for the Suffix 60 rule-set .
5890,6,Our method combines similarity-based estimates with Katz 's back-off scheme _comma_ which is widely used for language modeling in speech recognition .
5891,5,This can be achieved by adding the following structural relations to the tree description
5892,3,for each  and each _comma_ iff is defined _comma_ and .
5893,3,is a partial order _comma_
5894,3,The approach of the present paper has been driven by the view that
5895,4,In order to generate English correctly _comma_ it is necessary to know whether a given noun phrase is countable or uncountable and _comma_ if countable _comma_ whether it is singular or plural .
5896,3,Either conditioning on other parts of the parse tree than the mother node could be included _comma_ or a rather different scheme such as Briscoe and Carroll 's could be used .
5897,3,Recall that after john is type-raised _comma_ its LF will be  and similarly for bill .
5898,3,Various factors will lead us to conclude that a lexicalist statistical model with dependency relations is well suited to this goal .
5899,3,Some test results are given .
5900,3,Semantic understanding is necessary to distinguish between the states described by phrases of the form `` to be adjective '' and the processes described by phrases of the form `` to be past participle '' .
5901,4,Defeasibility is a notion that is tricky to deal with _comma_ and scholars in logics and pragmatics have learned to circumvent it or live with it .
5902,3,We in fact introduced some hierarchy into the endings : e.g. ment is shared by adverbs and nouns _comma_ while iquement is assigned to adverbs only .
5903,2,However _comma_ under first-order unification _comma_ this needs to simulated by having the variable x in  unify both with Bill and John _comma_ and this is not possible .
5904,2,ND proofs were tested as input to an early version of the MUMBLE system of McDonald 1983 _comma_ the main aim however _comma_ was to show the feasibility of the architecture .
5905,3,For example _comma_ Ben gave some books to Sue has the transitions :
5906,3,Thus the major factor in the learning process is the lexicon .
5907,3,Proposition 21 .
5908,3,The same compiled forms are used for analysis and generation _comma_ but are indexed differently .
5909,5,In particular _comma_ there has arisen a distinct paradigm of processing on the basis of pre-analyzed data which has taken the name Data-Oriented Parsing .
5910,5,Logogens in a verbal system are also interconnected with associative connections .
5911,4,And looking beyond Ireland _comma_ many have commented that the language of Ulster in general is similar to that of Scotland .
5912,5,In other words _comma_ the hearer can understand a referring expression if its content uniquely describes an object that he knows about .
5913,5,For the sake of simplicity _comma_ we assume that the open leaves  resp .
5914,3,MaxT is the set of parses of S by C that have the highest threshold value .
5915,7,This section elaborates on the communicative norms concerning how a proof to be presented can be split into subproofs _comma_ as well as how the hierarchically-structured subproofs can be mapped onto some linear order for presentation .
5916,3,We thank Dr. K. Yamanishi of C & C Res. Labs. for his comments .
5917,3,Although the scheme was originally proposed as a preferred way of implementing the independence assumption _comma_ we suggest that it is also appropriate for implementing similarity-based models _comma_ as well as class-based models .
5918,3,Each sub tree of the rhetorical structure forms an argumentative constituent _comma_ just as each sub-tree of the syntactic tree forms a grammatical constituent .
5919,3,During the first experiment _comma_ it became apparent that Baum-Welch re-estimation sometimes decreases the accuracy as the iteration progresses .
5920,3,Although these instruments are currently slightly too blunt to enable producing grammars with the same high performance as the hand-coded tree-cutting criteria _comma_ they can most probably be sharpened by future research _comma_ and in particular refined to achieve the delicate balance between high coverage and a distribution of reduction lengths that is sufficiently biased towards long reductions .
5921,5,It can be used to specify the states of a left to right parser and the possible mappings between states .
5922,4,The goal of grammar induction is taken to be finding the grammar with the largest a posteriori probability given the training data _comma_ that is _comma_ finding the grammar G ' where
5923,3,This work was supported in part by National Science Foundation Grant IRI - 9009018 _comma_ National Science Foundation Grant IRI - 9350192 _comma_ and a grant from the Xerox Corporation .
5924,3,But if a program is to catch such errors very soon after they are entered _comma_ it will have to operate with less than the complete sentence .
5925,1,I describe a compiler and development environment for feature-augmented two-level morphology rules integrated into a full NLP system .
5926,3,Also _comma_ banning recursion by category specialization _comma_ i.e. by for example distinguishing NPs that dominate other NPs from those that do not _comma_ will be investigated _comma_ since this is believed to be an important ingredient in the version of the scheme employing hand-coded tree-cutting criteria .
5927,3,The relative unacceptability of the examples in  is perhaps best explained as due to violations of intonational requirements _comma_ rather than syntactic requirements Steedman 1989 .
5928,2,But there will be no helpful subgoal reordering for rules with semantic head recursion :
5929,3,If we interpret the S _comma_ O and V as Subject _comma_ Object and Verb we can observe an equivalence between the structures with the bracketings :  _comma_ _comma_ _comma_ .
5930,2,This approach has many strong points _comma_ but does not provide a very satisfactory account of the adherence to discourse conventions in dialogue .
5931,2,The traditional problems of training times do not arise .
5932,1,In this paper we presented a new model that implements the similarity-based approach to provide estimates for the conditional probabilities of unseen word cooccurrences .
5933,3,I am grateful for helpful comments to Steve Finch _comma_ Jan Pedersen and two anonymous reviewers ( from ACL and EACL ) .
5934,3,Note that in a ` terminal ' DRS ( ready for an embedding test ) _comma_ all the auxiliary Rpts ` disappear ' ( do not participate in the embedding ) .
5935,3,where  is the frequency of in and = _comma_ and find the value of this quantity for all possible merged clusters .
5936,3,For each symbol that occurs on the right-hand side of a rule but which was not one of the most frequent 20 symbols _comma_ we create a rule that expands that symbol to a unique terminal symbol .
5937,3,a sufficiently large text for training the HMM _comma_
5938,3,The PLPATR recognition algorithm employs a second array ( called the compatibility array ) _comma_ which encodes information about the compatibility of derived feature structures .
5939,3,Therefore we don't deal with category  in this paper .
5940,3,The developed techniques are direction independent in the sense that they can be used for both generation and parsing with HPSG grammars .
5941,5,are matched by ( feature ) term unification with the corresponding mother nodes in the grammar rule .
5942,3,By the same token _comma_ however _comma_ PLIG may only generate structural descriptions in which dependent branches begin at nodes that are siblings of one another .
5943,3,As an upper bound _comma_ Judge 2 was correct on 65.7 % of those test instances .
5944,3,These improvements haven't been implemented yet and will be the object of further works .
5945,5,Both techniques can be thought of as marking the wh-arguments as requiring special treatment _comma_ and therefore do not lead to unwanted effects elsewhere in the grammar .
5946,3,Combining the meanings for Hillary _comma_ found _comma_ supported _comma_ and and _comma_ Axiom I _comma_ and R-relations  _comma_ _comma_ _comma_ _comma_ _comma_ and _comma_ we can derive :
5947,3,Note that since c is a scoped constant arising from the proof of an universal quantification _comma_ the instantiation
5948,3,We represent a tree with a list notation .
5949,3,When the anaphor is included in a PP ( particular case of  ) _comma_ PP attachment rules need semantic information about the `` object '' of the PP ; when it is a pronoun _comma_ no semantic information is available _comma_ so that the attachment rules can not be applied .
5950,5,The main advantage of the Xerox tagger when compared with earlier implementations of HMM taggers is that it can be trained using untagged text .
5951,3,In the probabilistic type hierarchy _comma_ it is the iterated introduction relationships which correspond to the context-free rewrite rules of a PCFG .
5952,3,Hence from a path set S _comma_ we can read off an f-structure  .
5953,3,The results in Tables  and give an indication of performance levels .
5954,4,With the availability of large corpora and fast computers _comma_ there has been a recent resurgence of interest _comma_ and a number of variations on and alternatives to the FB _comma_ Viterbi and BW algorithms have been tried Church 1988 _comma_ Brill and Marcus 1992a _comma_ Brill 1992 _comma_ DeRose 1988 and Kupiec 1992 .
5955,5,The linguistic study of French intransitive motion verbs Asher and Sablayrolles 1994a we have realized has allowed the definition of an ontology for `` location '' in three basic concepts :
5956,3,The system imposes a penalty on the left node for the RightNucleus relation _comma_ and also on the right node for the LeftNucleus relation .
5957,3,This metric gives us the exact measure of how the tagger has done on unknown words .
5958,3,First we measure the accuracy of tagging solely on unknown words :
5959,5,M and C suggest various possibilities for packing the partial syntax trees _comma_ including using Tree Adjoining Grammar Joshi 1987 or Description Theory Marcus et al. 1983 .
5960,2,But belief revision is surely an autonomous process ; agents can choose whether to accept a new belief or revise old beliefs Galliers 1991 _comma_ Grosz and Sidner 1990 .
5961,3,The feature value `` compulsory '' indicates that if the applicability condition is satisfied _comma_ and the style of the operator conforms to the global style the text planner is committed to _comma_ this operator should be chosen .
5962,3,These membranes becomes their scopes for case ( or role ) domination ; namely _comma_ each verb searches for molecules ( noun phrases ) that are necessary to satisfy each verb 's case ( role ) frame _comma_ within its membrane .
5963,3,Accurate distance matrices _comma_ corresponding highly to those obtained by the tedious uncovering of thousands of isoglosses _comma_ can be obtained by averaging the Levenshtein distance between phonetic strings _comma_ weighting equally all insertion _comma_ deletion _comma_ and substitution operations on the constituent phones .
5964,3,The pattern matching capabilities of neural networks can be used to locate syntactic constituents of natural language .
5965,3,We can express these observations about partial and total downstep in the model as follows .
5966,3,The DRS in Figure  describes the complex state _comma_ that after each event of John 's coming home _comma_ there is a sequence of subsequent events according to his activities .
5967,3,The corresponding corpus should include most of the words from the lexicon and be large enough to obtain reliable estimates of word-frequency distribution .
5968,3,Regardless of what techniques are used for parsing disambiguation _comma_ one thing is clear : if a particular piece of information is necessary for solving a disambiguation problem _comma_ it must be made available to the disambiguation mechanism .
5969,5,Note also that the model will correctly fail to reanalyse for sentence  above _comma_ since the reanalysis will require the retraction of the domination relation between the VP of the adverbial clause and the NP the ice cream .
5970,3,They were constructed manually and refined in a series of subsequent training and evaluation runs .
5971,3,In addition _comma_ a paraphrase and making an inference explicit provides linguistic evidence of what proposition the paraphraser believes the previous utterance realizes .
5972,3,This rule states that if looking for a Y and get a Z then look for a Y which is missing a Z .
5973,4,All of syntactic _comma_ semantic _comma_ and pragmatic constraints are to be involved to resolve zero anaphora .
5974,5,Hirschberg and Pierrehumbert 1986 showed that intonational contour is closely related to discourse segmentation with new topics being signalled by changes in intonational contour .
5975,6,Other preferences _comma_ such as a preference for relating the new DCU to a thread with parallel tense _comma_ are employed ( See Kameyama et al. 1993 _comma_ Poesio 1994 for details ) _comma_ and the resulting ratings are factored into the rating for each thread .
5976,2,However _comma_ with positive data alone a problem of over generalization arises : the postulated grammar may be a superset of the real grammar _comma_ and sentences that are outside the real grammar could be accepted .
5977,5,To the above _comma_ one adds language-independent issues in spell checking such as the four Damerau transformations : omission _comma_ insertion _comma_ transposition and substitution Damerau 1964 .
5978,3,In other words _comma_ using the formalism one should be able to characterize the structural regularities of language with at least the sophistication of modern competence grammars .
5979,3,If more than one possibility exists _comma_ semantic preferences are used to choose between the possibilities .
5980,4,This results in several distinctive features of collaborative negotiation :
5981,6,A detailed discussion about both procedures of anaphora resolution and PP attachment is largely developed in Azzam 1994 .
5982,4,Elements are uttered before the processing or input consumption has been finished .
5983,3,The Parallel relation relates utterances that share a common topic .
5984,3,The first reason for this is that for any spurious rule reduction to take place _comma_ the corresponding RHS phrases must be on the stack .
5985,3,In the second experiment we tagged the same text with the lexicon which contained only closed-class and short words .
5986,3,Each rule is listed with its identifier ( ` -1 ' for lexical rules ) _comma_ the island which it has analysed with beginning and ending positions _comma_ its coverage _comma_ and the representation that was constructed for it .
5987,3,The invocation of an ordering operator is always followed by the invocation of a splitting operator _comma_ which actually posts subgoals by calling the function Present with the ordered goals subsequently .
5988,3,Lemma 12 .
5989,3,In addition to words _comma_ it only required symbols for dependency relations _comma_ whereas the qualitative model required symbol sets for linguistic categories and features _comma_ and a set of word sense symbols .
5990,5,Early work in the field relied on a corpus which had been tagged by a human annotator to train the model .
5991,3,In more detail _comma_ SVD decomposes a matrix C _comma_ the matrix of left vectors in our case _comma_ into three matrices  _comma_ _comma_ and such that :
5992,3,Any word or phrase in that group that appears in the noun taxonomy for WordNet would be a candidate as a test instance -- for example _comma_ line _comma_ or secret writing .
5993,3,Coordinations are classified as non-constituent coordination if the conjuncts fail to be constituents in a ` standard ' phrase structure grammar .
5994,3,They can be defeated later by stronger evidence .
5995,5,In addition to its original use in language modeling for speech recognition _comma_ Grishman and Sterling 1993 applied the cooccurrence smoothing technique to estimate the likelihood of selectional patterns .
5996,3,This relates to there being no spurious ambiguity : each choice of transition has semantic consequences ; each choice affects whether a particular part of the semantics is to be modified or not .
5997,5,The first major use of HMMs for part of speech tagging was in CLAWS Garside et al. 1987 in the 1970s .
5998,3,This completes the proof .
5999,3,The experiments above demonstrate a number of important points .
6000,3,In this paper _comma_ we view the problem of learning case frame patterns as that of learning a multi-dimensional discrete joint distribution _comma_ where random variables represent case slots .
6001,3,Inappropriate scoping may leave undischarged and hence uninterpretable terms and indices ( which accounts for the so-called free-variable and vacuous quantification constraints on scope Alshawi and Crouch 1992 ) .
6002,3,Finally _comma_ here is a summary of our reasons for combining statistical methods with dependency representations in our language and translation models :
6003,3,This treatment of collocations rests _comma_ among others _comma_ on the assumptions that there are only a limited number of lexical functions _comma_ that lexical functions can be assigned consistently _comma_ that all ( or a significant number of ) collocations realise a lexical function _comma_ that lexical functions are not restricted to particular languages _comma_ etc .
6004,4,The realization of such an automatic construction method would make it possible to
6005,5,Rather than adapting the Application Rule to allow functions to be applied to one argument at a time _comma_ Bar-Hillel 's second system ( often called AB Categorial Grammar _comma_ or Adjukiewicz / Bar-Hillel CG _comma_ Bar-Hillel 1964 ) adopted a ` Curried ' notation _comma_ and this has been adopted by most CGs since .
6006,7,Here I present some data from my own fieldwork and give a statistical analysis _comma_ using the same technique used by Liberman et al. .
6007,2,It also follows from  that these models assume that agents are not autonomous _comma_ or at least do not have control over their own mental states .
6008,3,Although the hand-coded tree-cutting criteria are substantially better than the induced ones _comma_ we must remember that the former produce a grammar that in median allows 60 times faster processing than the original grammar and parser do .
6009,4,Therefore  and are both pro .
6010,3,Therefore it is important to distinguish an agent actually ACCEPTING the belief that p or intending to perform an action described by p from merely understanding that p was conveyed .
6011,3,A more general question is whether all ellipses involve recompositions _comma_ with variants _comma_ of linguistic antecedents .
6012,3,Since the Brown Corpus model is a general language model _comma_ it _comma_ in principle _comma_ does not put restrictions on the type of text it can be used for _comma_ although its performance might be slightly lower than that of a model specialised for this particular sublanguage .
6013,3,Lemma 13 .
6014,3,PET operates over a shifting window of text ( it can be attached simply and asynchronously to the Emacs editor ) .
6015,4,Two algorithms are commonly used _comma_ known as the Forward-Backward ( FB ) and Viterbi algorithms .
6016,2,For every possible category that can be conjoined _comma_ a separate lexical entry for and is required _comma_ and
6017,3,Each element of the vector will represent a feature that is flagged 0 or 1 _comma_ absent or present .
6018,3,The probability of a complete parse tree ( T ) of a sentence ( S ) is the product of each decision (  ) conditioned on all previous decisions :
6019,1,In this paper _comma_ I argue for a general method for extending the context-sensitivity of any knowledge source that calculates sentence hypothesis scores as linear combinations of scores for objects .
6020,5,Wagner also presents material from the Isle of Man and seven sites in Scotland .
6021,4,If contextually we can take only Hanako and the speaker of this sentence as candidates of antecedent of  or _comma_ intuitively the following two interpretations are equally likely .
6022,3,where MT is a set of maximal types  _comma_ NT is a set of non-maximal types _comma_ is the starting symbol and I is a set of introduction relationships of the form _comma_ where is a multiset of maximal and non-maximal types .
6023,3,In other words _comma_ object-level function application is handled simply by the meta-level function application .
6024,3,We use the term move set to describe the set of modifications we consider to the current hypothesis grammar to hopefully produce a superior grammar .
6025,3,if  has not been conveyed _comma_ then present ( subgoal 1 )
6026,3,This space _comma_ induced by the lref _comma_ is characterized by most of the authors in the literature by a two-part spatial system consisting in the inside and the outside of the lref .
6027,3,This is done by assigning an entropy value to each node in the parse trees and cutting in the nodes with sufficiently high entropy values .
6028,3,However _comma_ since there is no popping of a stack _comma_ the full parsing history is available .
6029,3,A rhetorical structure analysis determines logical relations between sentences based on linguistic clues _comma_ such as connectives _comma_ anaphoric expressions _comma_ and idiomatic expressions in the input text _comma_ and then recognizes an argumentative chunk of sentences .
6030,3,An agent understands a reference once he is confident in the adequacy of its ( inferred ) plan as a means of identifying the referent .
6031,3,With a good lexicon but either degraded transitions or a test corpus differing from the training corpus _comma_ the pattern tends to be early maximum .
6032,7,Section  presents a new method for testing the role of the hypothesized factors .
6033,3,Each time the representation is modified a new set of strings is generated that need marking up .
6034,3,The figure shows that sentence four and five have penalty score three _comma_ that sentence three has two _comma_ that sentence one and two have one _comma_ and that sentence six has no penalty score .
6035,5,More specifically _comma_ the head of the right-hand side of each grammar rule is distinguished _comma_ and distinguished categories are scanned or predicted upon first .
6036,3,In effect _comma_ the abstract specifications of the generation algorithms which we gave above _comma_ could be read as parsing algorithms _comma_ modulo a few changes ( of the success condition and the link relation ) .
6037,4,Infants must learn to recognize certain sound sequences as being words ; this is a difficult problem because normal speech contains no obvious acoustic divisions between words .
6038,2,Specifically _comma_ because the use of the simple past in passage  is as felicitous as the past perfect in passage under the explanation interpretation ( in these cases indicated explicitly by because ) _comma_ then it must be explained why passage is not understood as an explanation as is passage _comma_ where in each case the relationship needs to be inferred .
6039,3,The two rules specified so far need to be further generalised to allow for the case where a lexical item has more than one argument ( e.g. if we replace likes by a di-transitive such as gives or a tri-transitive such as bets ) .
6040,3,In order to compare the types of ambiguities that had to be resolved by the different language models for the HMM tagger _comma_ relative frequency tables of equivalence classes were computed for each of the three texts .
6041,3,The work of the second author was partially supported by a grant from the Israeli ministry of science `` Programming languages induced computational linguistics '' _comma_ and by the fund for the promotion of research in the Technion .
6042,5,Yarowsky 1992 's algorithm for sense disambiguation can be thought of as a way of determining how Roget 's thesaurus categories behave with respect to contextual features .
6043,3,Two weaker values also reflect the specificity of plan operators : `` specific '' and `` general '' .
6044,3,For example _comma_ we may wish to define real-valued functions on parse trees that reflect the extent to which the trees conform to _comma_ say _comma_ minimal attachment and parallelism between conjuncts .
6045,3,For every word we computed its metrics exactly as in the previous experiment .
6046,4,It is not difficult to see that there are 7 and only 7 such representations for the joint distribution  ( See Figure ) _comma_ disregarding the actual numerical values of the probabilistic parameters .
6047,1,The second deals with clustering .
6048,3,Since the discussion in P and Q is considered to close locally _comma_ structure  is preferable to .
6049,4,These are cases of ` zeugma ' and are unacceptable except as jokes .
6050,3,The system VM-GEN is used in the VERBMOBIL scenario for multilingual generation ( English _comma_ German _comma_ and Japanese ) .
6051,3,The use of a dummy verb and an underspecified verbal structure the NP is integrated into allows for a simple global test that rules out the same case value assignment to different NP complements as it is required for most of the German verbs .
6052,3,We verify _comma_ again via balancedness of the primitive counts _comma_ that  holds _comma_ because these are the numbers of positive and negative occurrences of in the sequent .
6053,3,Note however this is not at all the same problem of writing a  - reducer in Prolog .
6054,3,The result is shown in Table  .
6055,2,Computational approaches fail to account for the cancellation of pragmatic inferences : once presuppositions Weischedel 1979 or implicatures Hirschberg 1985 _comma_ Green 1992 are generated _comma_ they can never be cancelled .
6056,3,The accuracy of the taggers on the 2_comma_215 unknown words when they were made known to the lexicon was much lower than in the previous experiment -- 90.3 % for the Xerox tagger and 91.5 % for Brill 's tagger .
6057,3,where N = ( T c ) .
6058,3,For presentation purposes we only sketch the intended semantics of the simplified QLF notation used _comma_ and a more detailed discussion is deferred until section  .
6059,5,Chemical Abstract Machine ( ChAM _comma_ for short ) Berry and Boudol 1990 is a paradigm of concurrent - calculus .
6060,5,In the last twenty to thirty years there have been a series of accounts of coordination involving various deletion mechanisms ( from e.g. Gleitman 1965 to van Oirsouw 1987 ) .
6061,3,Whereas it is edited by some lexicographers _comma_ a dictionary is a set of associative relation shared by the people in a linguistic community .
6062,3,We will shortly provide an example .
6063,3,Different stages of processing place different requirements on the classification system _comma_ so customised tagsets have been developed .
6064,3,It is proposed that these features interact with one of two types of discourse inference _comma_ namely Common Topic inference and Coherent Situation inference .
6065,5,Katz thus assumes that for a given conditioning word the probability of an unseen following word is proportional to its unconditional probability .
6066,3,The basic well formed formulas ( basic wffs ) of are :  _comma_ where Patheq is defined as follows .
6067,4,The Penn treebank therefore uses a single tag for both cases _comma_ leaving the resolution - if required - to some other process .
6068,3,Naturally _comma_ the performance of the guessers was also lower than in the previous experiment plus the fact that many `` semi-closed '' class adverbs like `` however '' _comma_ `` instead '' _comma_ etc .
6069,5,This algorithm gives the correct results in examples such as the following :
6070,5,The rule ( hc-complete ) performs a 'head - corner ' completion step for a ( linked ) phrase  .
6071,4,An extragrammatical sentence is what a normal parser fails to analyze .
6072,3,General presentation operators perform a simple task according to some general text organization principles .
6073,4,Repeat step  until some stopping condition is met _comma_ to construct a thesaurus ( tree ) .
6074,3,However _comma_ connectionist methods have low computational loads at runtime .
6075,5,The case is actually a parallel to the earlier example of Mary introduced someone to something being inappropriate if the final sentence is Mary introduced noone to anybody .
6076,5,Grosz and Sidner 1986 relate the use of such phrases to changes in attentional state .
6077,3,For each such rule we form the analogous wff  ( just as we did in the previous example ) and then we form the disjunction of all such wffs .
6078,3,A treatment of the first issue will be articulated in a future forum .
6079,3,For partial downstep _comma_ we have  while for total downstep we have .
6080,5,Consider a situation in which an agent A wants an agent B to accept a proposal P .
6081,5,First note that the problem of calculating the intersection of a DCG and a FSA can be solved trivially by a generalization of the construction by Bar-Hillel et al. 1961 .
6082,3,Experiments were carried out to assess the effectiveness of clustering _comma_ and therefore the existence of unexploited contextual dependencies _comma_ for instances of two general types of language model .
6083,3,The experimental results presented show that clustering increases the ( absolute ) success rate of unigram and bigram language modeling for a particular ATIS task by up to about 12 % _comma_ and that performance improves steadily as the number of clusters climbs towards 100 ( probably a reasonable upper limit _comma_ given that there are only a few thousand training sentences ) .
6084,3,if  then output .
6085,4,In broken plurals _comma_ diminutives and deverbal nouns _comma_ the user may enter a morphologically sound _comma_ but morphosyntactically ill-formed word .
6086,5,There is precisely one Cb .
6087,3,The stronger constraint of immediate precedence is marked by ` : ' ; ` A : B ' indicates that the span of A precedes that of B _comma_ and that there is no uncovered input between the two .
6088,3,It therefore seems likely that implementational decisions and optimisations based on subtle properties of specific grammars can _comma_ and may very often be _comma_ more important than worst-case complexity when considering the practical performance of parsing algorithms .
6089,2,Firstly _comma_ even when the context is extended _comma_ some important influences may still not be modeled .
6090,3,As in the previous experiment we measured the precision _comma_ recall and coverage both on the lexicon and on the corpus .
6091,3,Focusing exclusively on the results of semantic composition _comma_ i.e. meanings _comma_ can ignore differences in how those meanings were derived that can be linguistically significant ( e.g. co-referential vs co-indexed terms ) .
6092,3,Like k and t _comma_  is tuned experimentally .
6093,3,The basis of our model is that the hearer can accept a referring expression plan if
6094,4,This research represents a step forward in the quest for developing grammar-based language models for natural language .
6095,3,This would account for cases like `` try - tries '' _comma_ `` reduce - reducing '' _comma_ `` advise - advisable '' .
6096,3,for any  and regular language R .
6097,5,This section discusses assumption  of the determistic model _comma_ namely that : Agents are logically omniscient .
6098,3,The treatment of  clearly requires much the same mechanism as we will require if we want to deal with focus as outlined above _comma_ and this may or may not also hold for .
6099,3,This processing described above has been implemented in ALT-J / E. It was tested _comma_ together with new processing to generate articles _comma_ on a specially constructed set of test sentences _comma_ and on a collection of newspaper articles .
6100,7,The appendix illustrates the application of the algorithm to figure  .
6101,3,S to

6106,3,general operators embodying general presentation norms _comma_ concerning splitting proofs and ordering subgoals .
6107,4,VP-ellipsis is characterized by an initial source sentence _comma_ and a subsequent target sentence with a bare auxiliary indicating the elision of a verb phrase :
6108,3,Explicit relation markers such as cue words and temporal relations must be consistent and take priority over indicators such as tense and aspect .
6109,3,Specifically _comma_ there are various ways to explore in order to reduce the problems stated in points  and above :
6110,3,Let GF be a metavariable over the modalities corresponding to the elements of this set _comma_ thus GF contains such items as  _comma_ _comma_ _comma_ and .
6111,4,There is also the strong connection between probability theory and the formal theory of information and communication _comma_ a connection that has been exploited in speech recognition _comma_ for example using the concept of entropy to provide a motivated way of measuring the complexity of a recognition problem Jelinek et al. 1992 .
6112,2,Furthermore _comma_ the constraints suggested in Grosz et al. 1986 succeed in many cases without invoking an independent structural parallelism constraint _comma_ due to the distinction between continuing and retaining _comma_ which Kameyama fails to consider .
6113,3,Finally _comma_ experimental results on these variations were reported .
6114,5,From a computational point of view _comma_ a hierarchical planner elaborates recursively on the initial communicative goal until the final subgoals can be achieved by applying a primitive operator .
6115,3,The Root and Infl lines show the features that differ between the root and inflected forms _comma_ while the Both line shows those that they share .
6116,4,Since derivability is known to be NP-complete _comma_ it is interesting to study restrictions on the use of the operator  .
6117,2,While this pushes first-order unification beyond what it had been previously shown capable of _comma_ there are two disadvantages to this technique :
6118,3,It seems unlikely that these continuously variable aspects of fluent natural language can be captured by a purely combinatoric model .
6119,3,If there is no temporal expression or cue phrase _comma_ tense and semantic aspect also influence the value of the RHET_RELN type ( See Table  ) _comma_ so that rhetorical relations _comma_ tense and aspect constrain each other .
6120,3,Whenever a new conversation act is determined to have been performed _comma_ then any future action that can be inferred from the conventional rules becomes an obligation .
6121,4,Naturally _comma_ there is co-variance .
6122,1,A novel approach to HPSG based natural language processing is described that uses an off-line compiler to automatically prime a declarative grammar for generation or parsing _comma_ and inputs the primed grammar to an advanced Earley-style processor .
6123,4,A lexical functional grammar consists of three main components : a set of context free rules annotated with schemata _comma_ a set of well formedness conditions on feature structures _comma_ and a lexicon .
6124,4,choosing criteria to cluster texts of the same genre _comma_ with predictable precision and recall .
6125,4,English has a very limited system _comma_ marking little more than plurality on nouns and a restricted range of verb properties .
6126,2,Thus _comma_ in contrast to employing MDL _comma_ it will not have the effect of smoothing at all .
6127,3,All through the process in Fig.  _comma_ C - and B-combinators are used repeatedly as well as ordinary type inference and .
6128,3,We also looked at when no signal was given ( interruptions ) .
6129,1,The general aim of this paper is to show how to use focus to decompose the interpretation of a phrase into two parts _comma_ where one part is the interpretation of the focussed item and the other is some object with which this can combine .
6130,3,The Rpt is reset during the processing of the discourse .
6131,3,and T a logic variable waiting instantiation .
6132,4,Rule based approaches have become more empirical in a number of ways :
6133,3,This is not difficult to determine _comma_ although the standard methods do not support automatic determination of standard deviation or skewness as discrimination criteria .
6134,3,One function of IRU 's is to address the assumptions on which mutual beliefs are based .
6135,4,Consider the following sentence .
6136,3,In incremental generation _comma_ as mentioned in section  _comma_ interleaved input consumption and output production causes specific default situations .
6137,3,if  ` true ' _comma_ ` true ' _comma_ and then set .
6138,3,If _comma_ e.g. _comma_ the noun `` Besucher '' ( English : `` visitor '' ) is known to be the agent of an action _comma_ it may be uttered as subject in the first position of the sentence by default .
6139,1,The solution given in this paper is to show how advances in logic programming allow the implementation of semantic theories in a very direct and natural way _comma_ using CCG as a case study .
6140,3,The interpretation of focus is just another example .
6141,7,Here we describe two types of inference used to enforce the constraints that are imposed by coherence relations .
6142,3,I is an interpretation iff [ I is a triple  _comma_
6143,3,The lookup relation and the choice of an indexing scheme must be specified by the user of the system .
6144,3,I have suggested that what is important is to choose the tagset required for the application _comma_ rather than to optimise it for the tagger .
6145,5,Let us consider a simple conversational sequence .
6146,3,The results support two main conclusions .
6147,5,The IntFilter Project at the departments of Computer and Systems Sciences _comma_ Computational Linguistics _comma_ and Psychology at Stockholm University is at present studying texts on the USENET News conferencing system .
6148,5,As a result _comma_ each f-structure contributed a single meaning constructor as a resource to be used in a derivation .
6149,3,The `` context-freeness '' of PLPATR means that given the three trees shown in Figures  and the tree shown in Figure will also be generated by the grammar .
6150,3,This paper is an attempt to bring together two approaches to language analysis .
6151,3,At this moment _comma_ we should explain the nature of the so called subjective predicate mentioned in Table  .
6152,3,The tag `` PRD '' stands for predicative uses of adjectives .
6153,3,a modality  _comma_ for each feature _comma_
6154,3,For example  would be analysed as with a broken plural vocalism .
6155,3,Single input increments are handed over to objects of a distributed parallel system _comma_ each of which tries to verbalize the structure that results from the corresponding input increment .
6156,3,If the recipient is not confident in the adequacy of the plan _comma_ he uses an instance of postpone-plan to inform the initiator that he is not confident of its adequacy _comma_ thereby causing the initiator to raise her own confidence threshold .
6157,3,The bulk of LFG involves stating constraints about a single model _comma_ and is well equipped for this task _comma_ but constraining equations involve looking at the structure of other possible parse trees .
6158,5,The original formulation has been extended to allow morphotactic constraints to be expressed by feature specification Trost 1990 _comma_ Alshawi et al. 1991 rather than Koskenniemi 's less perspicuous device of continuation classes .
6159,3,This will be used in the implementation of coordination as a test for termination of the recursion .
6160,5,In these cases negative information is not required _comma_ but they are not plausible models for unbounded natural language .
6161,5,As a strategy of statistical estimation MDL is guaranteed to be near optimal .
6162,4,As a consequence of underspecification _comma_ incremental generation is essentially based on working with defaults .
6163,4,However _comma_ an examination of a corpus of naturally-occurring problem-solving dialogues shows that agents often do not explicitly indicate acceptance or rejection .
6164,3,The similarity model was correct in 64 cases _comma_ and the back-off model in 32 .
6165,5,van Oirsouw allows deletion of words to the left and to the right of the conjunction _comma_
6166,3,is a finite partial function from the Cartesian product of Q and to Q _comma_
6167,1,In this paper we have presented some variations affecting the association measure and thresholding on the basic technique for learning SRs from on-line corpora .
6168,3,If our input ` sentence ' now is the definition of trans/3 as given above _comma_ we obtain the following parse forest grammar ( where the start symbol is
6169,3,Under two circumstances a writer may recognize that he is confronted with a proof segment containing cases .
6170,3,With respect to switching tagsets _comma_ we use contextual two-level rules that turn the initial tags into new tags or to the void symbol if old tags must simply disappear .
6171,3,For example _comma_ if  represents a simple past eventive sentence and a past perfect eventive sentence _comma_ then in spite of the lack of rhetorical cues we know that e precedes e _comma_ as in :
6172,3,As this example illustrates _comma_ a partial analysis of this kind may not in fact correspond to a true sub-parse of the input ( since Mary and Mark was not a conjoined subject in the original ) .
6173,3,The texts under consideration will probably be specific in some way .
6174,3,In practice _comma_ we keep track not of  but of the overall corpus entropy .
6175,3,Note that _comma_ the subproofs being ordered are subproofs conceptually planned while the corresponding proof is constructed .
6176,4,Natural Language Generation _comma_ i.e. _comma_ the process of building an adequate utterance for some given content _comma_ is by nature a decision-making problem Appelt 1985c .
6177,4,The glue language is the tensor fragment of linear logic Girard 1987 .
6178,2,Whereas they can provide even better solutions intrinsically _comma_ they are usually ad-hoc and are lack of extensibility .
6179,3,Structural transfer can be incorporated to improve the efficiency of generation _comma_ but it is never necessary for correctness or even tractability .
6180,5,The project uses categories such as `` query '' _comma_ `` comment '' _comma_ `` announcement '' _comma_ `` FAQ '' _comma_ and so forth _comma_ categorizing them using parameters such as different types of length measures _comma_ form word content _comma_ quote level _comma_ percentage quoted text and other USENET News specific parameters .
6181,3,In general what we will look at in the results is how the tagging accuracy changes as the size of the tagset changes .
6182,3,Using this parameter we identified three levels of structure in the dialogues :
6183,3,At this stage the tagset _comma_ mode 2 _comma_ includes number information and has 28 classes .
6184,5,B can either accept it _comma_ reject it _comma_ or postpone his decision until later .
6185,5,Phrase markers are those partial phrase markers which have no non-terminal leaves .
6186,3,We are thus lead to the approach of approximating the target joint distribution by such a simplified model _comma_ based on corpus data .
6187,4,The scientific questions arise in connection to distributional views of linguistic ( particularly lexical ) structure and also in relation to the question of lexical acquisition both from psychological and computational learning perspectives .
6188,3,An action is forbidden if it is not permissible .
6189,1,We have given an account of resource sharing in the syntax / semantics interface of LFG .
6190,3,Essentially _comma_ the uniqueness principle is enforced by two choices .
6191,5,A complete phrase marker of the input string can then be constructed by following the manner in which the mother node from one proper branch is used as a daughter node in a dominating proper branch .
6192,1,This paper is concerned with symmetrical coordination _comma_ where the order of the conjuncts ( the items being coordinated by a conjunction such as and or or ) can be altered without affecting acceptability .
6193,3,As in the above-cited work _comma_ there is no presupposition that sense-annotated text is available .
6194,1,We account for several facets of the identification of temporal relations through an integration of these .
6195,5,For example _comma_ we can restrict the attention to DCGs of which the context-free skeleton does not contain cycles .
6196,3,A context-free grammar is represented as a definite-clause specification as follows .
6197,4,What determines the speaker 's choice ?
6198,3,Within an input string consisting of the terminals  _comma_ an island is a subsequence _comma_ whose length is m + 1 .
6199,2,Unfortunately _comma_ whatever the criterion selected _comma_ it is in general impractical to find the optimal clustering of the data ; instead _comma_ one of a variety of algorithms must be used to find a locally optimal solution .
6200,3,The QLFs shown above omitted category information present in terms and forms .
6201,3,No clash of temporal relations is predicted by our account _comma_ because the use of the simple pasts do not in themselves imply a specific ordering between them .
6202,3,The disambiguation procedure aims at filling the empty roles using attachment rules .
6203,3,On the other hand _comma_ if temporal expressions indicate an overlap relation and cue words indicate a background relation as in  _comma_ these contributions are consistent and the RHET_RELN type will contain a background value ( the more specific value of the two ) :
6204,5,`` Since a is an element of U _comma_ a is an element of F. ''
6205,3,We have embedded the concept in an HPSG-like grammar theory .
6206,4,Since conversation is a collaborative process Clark and Wilkes-Gibbs 1986 _comma_ Sacks et al. 1974 _comma_ models of conversation can provide the basis for extending planning theories Grosz and Sidner 1990 _comma_ Cohen et al. 1990 .
6207,3,To use the MDL principle _comma_ as introduced above _comma_ we search for the smallest-sized hypothesis .
6208,3,Indefinite NPs should be viewed as a way of introducing items ( or preferably sets of items ) into the discourse .
6209,3,Let  be a shorthand for ( * ) _comma_ and let X stand for the sequence of primitive types .
6210,3,In addition _comma_ other predicates can be used to search the chart for constituents that have been identified but have not been attached to the parse tree .
6211,3,Most parsers which work left to right along an input string can be described in terms of state transitions i.e. by rules which say how the current parsing state ( e.g. a stack of categories _comma_ or a chart ) can be transformed by the next word into a new state .
6212,3,However _comma_ intuitively _comma_ of the above sentences _comma_ it is only  which causes the conscious garden path effect .
6213,3,Again _comma_ errors mainly affect the assignment of words to subclasses within one major word class .
6214,3,the iteration at which it occurred _comma_ and the pattern of re-estimation ( I = initial maximum _comma_ E = early maximum _comma_ C = classical ) .
6215,3,These should be distinguished from possibly correct parses that are not in the training data .
6216,3,adjective vs. noun vs. verb ( return _comma_ field ) _comma_
6217,3,Recall that a Semitic stems consists of a root morpheme and a vocalism morpheme arranged according to a canonical pattern morpheme .
6218,4,As the result _comma_  is controlled by the subject of the main VP _comma_ which is also zero subject .
6219,3,All three of the parsers have theoretical worst-case complexities that are either exponential _comma_ or polynomial on grammar size but with an extremely large multiplier .
6220,2,But _comma_ ideally _comma_ salience should depend on the context surrounding the referent .
6221,5,This yields a binary tree .
6222,3,In incremental parsing we cannot predict which words will appear in the sentence _comma_ so cannot use the same technique .
6223,3,The first ordering operator operationalizes a general ordering strategy called minimal load principle .
6224,3,This is of particular importance for applications in machine translation _comma_ where one wants to avoid the resolution of scope relations as long as the underspecified meaning can be rendered in the source and in the target language .
6225,3,It was a forced-choice task ; that is _comma_ the judge was required to choose exactly one sense .
6226,3,At this point a further  - reduction is needed .
6227,5,Activation of associative connections between logogens is called associative processing .
6228,5,Bar-Hillel employed a single application rule _comma_ which corresponds to the following :
6229,3,is a morph _comma_ and
6230,3,These must be converted to binary vectors .
6231,3,lhip_threshold_value/1 unifies its argument M with the current global threshold value .
6232,3,Weakest Link Assumption :
6233,3,To do that for each rule-set produced using different thresholds we recorded the three metrics and chose the set with the best aggregate .
6234,3,We can taxonomize previous approaches to defeasible pragmatic inferences into three categories ( we omit here work on defeasibility related to linguistic phenomena such as discourse _comma_ anaphora _comma_ or speech acts ) .
6235,3,The difficulty in these examples is determining whether the third sentence continues the thread begun by the first or second sentence .
6236,3,The important feature of the generated abstracts is that since they are composed of the rhetoricaly consistent units which consist of several sentences and form a rhetorical substructure _comma_ the abstract does not contain fragmentary sentences which cannot be understood alone .
6237,3,We specify this as follows .
6238,3,pre-subject - subject - predicate
6239,3,This states the syntactic tense _comma_ aspect and polarity marked on the ellipsis ( underscores indicate lack of specification ) .
6240,3,The SPATTER parsing algorithm is based on interpreting parsing as a statistical pattern recognition process .
6241,3,Writing rules that map a tag or a sequence of tags into a new tag is rather straightforward _comma_ but redefining the source lexicon would imply complex and time consuming work .
6242,3,There has already been some early work done on providing statistically based parsing using transitions between recursively structured syntactic categories Tugwell 1995 .
6243,3,The number of words which appeared at least once was about 50 % of the total 62 K head words of CED _comma_ and the percentage of the word-origin pairs which appeared at least once was about 16 % of total 62 K  1 K ( = 62 M ) pairs .
6244,5,The relative pronoun which would _comma_ for instance _comma_ receive category  with being implication in LP _comma_ i.e. _comma_ it requires as an argument `` an s lacking an np somewhere '' .
6245,3,In order to reduce the number of tags _comma_ cliticised items ( like vient-il are split into independent tokens for the tagging application .
6246,5,In the SLEMaT system Poznanski et al. 1993 _comma_ we have tried to form a good initial guess by mirroring the source structure in the target TNCB _comma_ and allowing some local structural modifications in the bilingual equivalences .
6247,5,The description will include the information that the verb knows precedes NP  _comma_ and that the VP dominates NP .
6248,3,The morphological analysis proceeds by selecting rules that hypothesise lexical strings for a given surface string .
6249,3,Of these 16 highest ranked parses _comma_ 7 are the expected parse _comma_ with the other 9 exhibiting some form of mis-attachment .
6250,3,Thus _comma_ for the query
6251,4,In the conventional generation _comma_ the rules for composition are given from the outside and those rules control all the behavior of the symbols or the objects _comma_ for assembling a hierarchical tree structure .
6252,3,We analyse word meaning in terms of the semantic space defined by a semantic network _comma_ called Paradigme .
6253,1,In this paper we describe briefly our discourse model and discuss the abstract generation system based on it .
6254,7,I shall now present the implementations .
6255,3,A first way of evaluation is by means of measuring precision and recall ratios in the testing sample .
6256,2,This means that these accounts cannot represent the fact that a belief must be supported by some kind of evidence and that the evidence may be stronger or weaker .
6257,5,Assuming that random variables ( case slots ) are mutually independent would drastically reduce the number of parameters .
6258,3,is a total function from to _comma_
6259,3,where  is thickness of the j-th subrfrant of .
6260,3,Structure sharing determines the dataflow within the rules of the grammar .
6261,3,Nevertheless this situation is rare .
6262,2,We are not aware of any formalism or computational approach that offers a unified explanation for the cancellability of pragmatic inferences in general _comma_ and of no approach that handles cancellations that occur in sequences of utterances .
6263,5,One category of rhetorical relation he describes is that of ELABORATION _comma_ in which a speaker repeats the propositional content of a previous utterance .
6264,3,This is clearly undesirable .
6265,3,But each agent has its own set of individual rules _comma_ and we do not need to appeal to shared knowledge to account for local discourse behavior .
6266,3,The acquisition of word-POS guessing rules is a three-step procedure which includes the rule extraction _comma_ rule scoring and rule merging phases .
6267,3,Suggestions have been made to look for low frequency words in corpora and news / mail archives _comma_ and to the Longmans learner corpus ( not native speakers ) .
6268,3,We illustrate its use by showing how to capture the effect of schemata annotated rules _comma_ and the LFG uniqueness _comma_ completeness and coherence principles .
6269,3,Since the bottom-up algorithm does not have a prediction step _comma_ there is no need for the costly operation of subsumption checking .
6270,3,For example in ` Mammoths are animals ' _comma_ ` mammoth ' has the semantic category ANIMAL so the sentence is judged to be stating a fact true of all mammoths and is thus generic .
6271,2,Firstly _comma_ it involves clustering whole sentences _comma_ not words .
6272,5,The first observers of the phenomenon preferred to keep defeasibility outside the mathematical world .
6273,4,Harry 's assertion in  simply paraphrases what was said in and and so it cannot be adding beliefs to the common ground .
6274,2,They require a relatively large tagged training text .
6275,3,With respect to nouns _comma_ we first selected productive endings ( iste _comma_ eau _comma_ eur _comma_ rice ) _comma_ until we realised a better choice was to assign a noun tag to all endings _comma_ with the exception of those previously assigned to other classes .
6276,5,at the point after encountering and _comma_ the parser can reaccess the configuration after parsing John gave i.e. a stack consisting of a sentence and a verb-phrase _comma_ and an arc traversal by the verb .
6277,3,I believe it is virtually impossible to do this kind of work without embodying it in a working system .
6278,2,This rules out examples such as the following _comma_
6279,3,Verbs and some other auxiliary verbs introduces membranes .
6280,3,This paper gives an overview of how natural language is converted to a representation that the neural nets can handle _comma_ and how the problem is reduced to a manageable size .
6281,7,Section  concludes .
6282,3,global organisation .
6283,3,The tags used in the ELWIS tag set are given in table  .
6284,5,The characterization of IRU 's as informationally redundant follows from an axiomatization of action in dialogue that I will call the DETERMINISTIC MODEL .
6285,3,The unreduced context vectors in the experiment described here have 250 entries _comma_ corresponding to the 250 most frequent words in the Brown corpus .
6286,3,A distributional analysis of a subset of the corpus ( 171 IRU 's from 24 dialogues consisting of 976 turns ) _comma_ on the relation of an IRU to its antecedent and the context _comma_ shows that 35 % of the tokens occur remotely from their antecedents _comma_ that 32 % have more than one antecedent _comma_ that 48 % consist of the speaker repeating something that he said before and 52 % consist of the speaker repeating something that the other conversant said .
6287,3,relative entropy between held-out data and the asymmetric model _comma_ and
6288,3,In such a case _comma_ two membranes can interact and can exchange some molecules .
6289,3,The macroplanner of PROVERB combines hierarchical planning with local organization in a uniform planning framework .
6290,4,A further observation is that Bamileke Dschang does not have downdrift _comma_ and so there is no F  difference across HLH and LHL sequences .
6291,3,The resolution of the anaphor is then postponed to the second phase of anaphora resolution .
6292,5,Both Woods and Dahl and McCord use stack based configurations rather than a full parsing history .
6293,3,The right-context neighbors of `` onto '' contain verbs because both prepositions and verbs govern noun phrases to their right .
6294,3,A further ambiguity is that when the third sentence is past perfect _comma_ it may be a continuation of a preceding thread or the start of a new thread itself .
6295,3,We test 4 factors outlined in figure  : when the warrant is salient or not _comma_ when the warrant is required for the task or not _comma_ when the costs of retrieval and communication vary _comma_ and when retrieval is indeterminate .
6296,3,Because of the computational demands of our algorithm _comma_ it is currently impractical to apply it to large vocabulary or large training set problems .
6297,3,In sum _comma_ the felicity of both gapping and VP-ellipsis appears to be dependent on the type of coherence relation extant between the source and target clauses .
6298,3,Type indicates the diagnostic about the class appropriateness .
6299,3,Maximally specified feature structures are those feature structures which have only maximal leaves .
6300,2,But if we use existing techniques for parsing DCGs _comma_ then we are also confronted with an undecidability problem : the recognition problem for DCGs is undecidable Pereira and Warren 1983 .
6301,3,Even if there is not an exact isomorphism between the source and target commutative bracketings _comma_ the first guess is still reasonable as long as the majority of child commutative bracketings in the target language are isomorphic with their equivalents in the source language .
6302,3,Since more than one such node is often available _comma_ the local focus mechanism is employed to single out the candidate having the strongest semantic links with the focal centers .
6303,2,But it is natural to have implicatures and presuppositions that are inferred and cancelled as a sequence of utterances proceeds : research in conversation repairs Hirst et al. 1994 abounds in such examples .
6304,3,Once a given rule or set of rules is stable _comma_ and the writer is satisfied with the performance of that part of the grammar _comma_ a local threshold value of 1 may be assigned so that superfluous parses will not interfere with work elsewhere .
6305,5,It also may be useful to include some features of human dialogue in man-machine dialogue .
6306,1,I have suggested that training corpus clustering can be used both to extend the effectiveness of a very general class of language models _comma_ and to provide evidence of whether a particular language model could benefit from extending it by hand to allow it to take better account of context .
6307,4,Bamileke Dschang has downstep but not downdrift while Igbo has downdrift but only very limited downstep .
6308,2,Neither approach is without problems .
6309,3,If there is such a discrepancy _comma_ the interruption is a necessary contribution to a collaborative plan _comma_ not a distraction from the joint activity .
6310,3,An incremental processing scheme allows for an increase of efficiency and flexibility _comma_ e.g. _comma_ by making the analysis and generation processes of a system for simultaneous interpretation overlap in time .
6311,3,Recall that this annotated rule licenses structures consisting of a binary tree whose mother node m is labeled S and whose daughter nodes  and are labeled NP and VP respectively ; and where _comma_ furthermore _comma_ the S and VP nodes ( that is _comma_ m and ) are related to the same f-structure node w ; while the NP node ( that is _comma_ ) is related to the node w ' in the f-structure that is reached by making a subj transition from w .
6312,4,It is not difficult to show that only that portion of the derivation below the terminator node is dependent on more than the top of the stack  .
6313,5,Suppose that the data is given as in Figure  and there are 4 nodes ( random variables ) .
6314,5,A reference network of the words in a dictionary ( Fig.  ) is used to measure the distance between words .
6315,3,As we predicted _comma_ the distribution of control between expert and client is completely different in the ADs and the TODs .
6316,3,The important points to note about this converted form are the following :
6317,3,Calculating  combining and _comma_ and applying the EM Algorithm Dempster et al. 1977 to improve the model .
6318,3,The algorithm we proposed in this paper _comma_ is independent of the used approaches in both anaphora and attachment modules .
6319,3,F is true of u under I iff [ F is a feature structure  _comma_
6320,3,The advantage of this approach is _comma_ that processing is continued in a consistent way _comma_ which eases the introduction of the input-licensed value .
6321,3,Noun phrases modified by Japanese / English pairs that are translated as denumerators we call denumerated .
6322,5,An early attempt at automation was made by Wilks et al. 1990 using co-occurrence statistics .
6323,3,R-relations are represented as three-place predicates of the form  which indicate that ( the path set ) G appears at the end of a path P ( of length 1 ) extending ( the path set ) F .
6324,3,If information of the first type is missing ( e.g. _comma_ because of problems during analysis _comma_ see section  ) _comma_ an assumption can be made locally by simulating the respective part of the input .
6325,3,Tests of the system with small grammars have shown promising results _comma_ and a medium-scale HPSG for German is presently being implemented in GeLD .
6326,1,This paper began with a discussion of the problem of relating tone transcriptions to their physical counterparts _comma_ namely F  traces .
6327,3,As mentioned at the beginning _comma_ the specialized grammar is compiled into LR parsing tables .
6328,7,This section provides two non-deterministic techniques for transcribing an F  string .
6329,3,The authors have investigated all pairs of rhetorical relations and derived those preference rules .
6330,3,We also evaluated the method by conducting pp-attachment disambiguation experiments using an automatically constructed thesaurus .
6331,2,Consider the sentence :
6332,3,As a result of its skipping capabilities _comma_ GLR* succeeds to parse 58 sentences ( 48 % ) that were not parsable by the original GLR parser .
6333,7,These are considered separately in the next two sections .
6334,3,This localization of constraint was found by introducing new pragmatic roles observer and motivated _comma_ and is extremely important for efficiency of UG based parsing .
6335,3,Compared with proofs found in mathematical textbooks _comma_ the output of PROVERB is still too tedious and inflexible .
6336,3,Then  is satisfied at a tree node t iff there is a feature structure node w that can be reached from t by making both the transition sequence and the transition sequence .
6337,3,calculate the preferences of every structure of the compound noun according to the frequencies of category collocations
6338,2,This result is neither interpretation  nor shown above .
6339,4,Its root-and-pattern phenomenon not only poses difficulties for a morphological system _comma_ but also makes error detection a difficult task .
6340,4,It can be argued that a smaller tagset should improve tagging accuracy _comma_ since it puts less of a burden on the tagger to make fine distinctions .
6341,6,This provide an appropriate basis for a discourse theory which handles reference choices Huang 1994b .
6342,3,pi is the meta-level operator for  _comma_ and is written as .
6343,5,Evaluations of the grammars in these particular systems have shown them to have wide coverage Alshawi et al. 1992 _comma_ Taylor et al. 1989 .
6344,2,So what is new ?
6345,5,At the end of the process of parsing a sentence _comma_ the GLR* parser returns with a set of possible parses _comma_ each corresponding to some grammatical subset of words of the input sentence .
6346,1,We describe here an approach to sentence categorization which has the originality to be based on natural properties of languages with no training set dependency .
6347,3,We need to allow for the possibility that an agent has performed an action even when this violates expectations .
6348,3,For example _comma_ sometimes even fully countable nouns can be used in uncountable noun phrases .
6349,7,Section  describes the substitutional treatment of ellipsis by way of a few examples presented in a simplified version of Quasi Logical Form ( QLF ) Alshawi and Crouch 1992 _comma_ Alshawi et al. 1992 .
6350,3,For the opposite case where the default must be withdrawn we have to mark all defaults .
6351,4,Grammarians _comma_ the human decision-makers in parsing _comma_ solve this problem by enumerating the features of a sentence which affect the disambiguation decisions and indicating which parse to select based on the feature values .
6352,3,However _comma_ the head of the subject is then found and number agreement with the verb can be assessed .
6353,3,there is a well-tuned statistical scoring procedure which accounts for rule features and frequency distribution ;
6354,3,This can be done using for example interval bisection .
6355,3,It will be helpful to introduce one more level of generality .
6356,3,The name of the language having the optimum likelihood will tag the sentence -- but non resolved ambiguities will be maintained .
6357,3,But an event can only elaborate another event _comma_ as in  :
6358,3,In the second experiment _comma_ evaluation was on the basis of grammar rules used rather than word occurrences .
6359,3,Even a clustering that only partly reflects the underlying variability of the data may give us more accurate predictions of utterance likelihoods .
6360,3,The proposed anchors represent all the co-specification relationships available for this utterance .
6361,7,In this section I present a number of examples for evaluation by inspection .
6362,3,In addition _comma_ this analysis has shown _comma_ that at least for task-oriented dialogues global focus is a significant factor _comma_ and in general discourse structure is more important in the task dialogues .
6363,3,If this value exceeds his confidence threshold _comma_ then he will accept the plan .
6364,5,Word-based approach infers SRs as the collection of words that co-occur significantly in the syntactic context of the studied word .
6365,3,These desiderata can be met by making use of a propositional language augmented with
6366,3,Each word  is mapped onto a link or links in _comma_ in the following way :
6367,3,In addition to predictive power evaluations of the kind we have already carried out _comma_ it might be worth comparing automatically-derived clusters with human judgements in a suitable experimental setting .
6368,4,Checking whether the intersection is empty or not is then usually very simple as well : only in the latter case will the parser terminate succesfully .
6369,3,These statistics can thus be seem as a weak form of object labelling analogous to supervision .
6370,3,Using the prototype on technical manuals the subject and its head can be detected in over 90 % of cases ( See Section  ) .
6371,3,This heightens the similarities within clusters and the differences between them .
6372,3,The PP attachment procedure is then called to determine the attachment of since and at while the object of the in PP comprises an anaphoric pronoun its ( case  ) and the on PP is preceded by its .
6373,3,The corpus used for extracting co-occurrence triples is a fragment of parsed material from the Penn Treebank Corpus ( about 880_comma_000 words and 35_comma_000 sentences ) _comma_ consisting of articles of the Wall Street Journal _comma_ that has been tagged and parsed .
6374,5,Dalrymple et al. 1993b provides an account of LFG semantics that represents the meaning of lexical items with linear logic formulas .
6375,3,Suppose that  and is a bijection from ordinal to .
6376,2,Even though the cumulative effects of such differences may be great when one considers the ends of the continua ( such as southern Italian versus northern French ) _comma_ still it seems arbitrary to draw major dialect boundaries between two villages with very similar speech patterns .
6377,4,However consider the following excerpt from the middle of an advisory dialogue between Harry ( h ) _comma_ a talk show host _comma_ and Ray ( r ) his caller .
6378,5,Many Japanese linguists have already done the enormous amount of basic observations and proposed linguistic theories about the phenomena we deal with in this paper Mikami 1953 _comma_ Kuno 1973 _comma_ Kuno 1978 _comma_ Ohye 1975 _comma_ Minami 1974 _comma_ Takubo 1987 _comma_ Teramura 1984 _comma_ Teramura 1990 _comma_ Saito 1992 .
6379,5,Suitable languages for dynamics are both formal and declarative _comma_ and are therefore also appropriate to express linguistic generalisations .
6380,4,As INITIATIVE passes back and forth between the discourse participants _comma_ we say that CONTROL over the conversation gets transferred from one discourse participant to another .
6381,3,A potential explanation for the significantly higher average parsing times for all grammars extracted using the induced tree-cutting criteria is that these are in general recursive _comma_ while the hand-coded criteria do not allow recursion _comma_ and thus only produce grammars that generate finite languages .
6382,4,Extracting case frames from corpus data _comma_
6383,1,This kind of clustering offers a way to represent important contextual effects and can therefore significantly improve the performance of a model .
6384,4,Similarly _comma_ most tagsets do not distinguish transitive and intransitive verbs _comma_ since taggers which use a context of only two or three words will generally not be able to make the right predictions .
6385,1,We have suggested some ways in which LFs can be enriched with lexical semantic information to improve translation quality .
6386,3,To explore the relationship of control to planning _comma_ we compare the TODs with both types of ADs ( financial and support ) .
6387,4,Yet _comma_ typically agents will still respond in such situations .
6388,3,Of course default evidence is weaker than linguistic evidence .
6389,2,However _comma_ the conditions under which a representation of an utterance may serve as a suitable basis for interpreting subsequent elliptical forms remain poorly understood ; specifically _comma_ past attempts to characterize these processes within a single traditional module of language processing ( e.g. _comma_ considering either syntax _comma_ semantics _comma_ or discourse in isolation ) have failed to account for all of the data .
6390,3,Initially _comma_ the set of nonterminal symbols consists of a different nonterminal symbol expanding to each terminal symbol .
6391,3,As for machine translation _comma_ we should take advantage of our understandings of
6392,2,it controls reasoning when discrepancies in mutual beliefs are discovered since evidence and assumptions can be inspected ;
6393,5,As in the experiments above _comma_ BW re-estimation gave a decrease in accuracy when the starting point was derived from a significant amount of hand-tagged text .
6394,3,Therefore there is an X _comma_  .
6395,3,We must therefore show that phonotactics can indeed be learned without access to a lexicon -- without such a demonstration _comma_ we are trapped in circular reasoning .
6396,3,In addition _comma_ we analyzed manually the results obtained for a subset of the extracted triples _comma_ looking at the sentences in the corpus where they occurred .
6397,5,Definitions of these transition types appear in figure  .
6398,6,However _comma_ we feel the largest contribution of this work does not lie in the actual algorithm specified _comma_ but rather in its indication of the potential of the induction framework described by Solomonoff in 1964 .
6399,3,U is a set _comma_
6400,3,for any  and context-free language L .
6401,5,A general algorithm for least-errors recognition _comma_ which is based only on syntactic information _comma_ was proposed by G. Lyon to deal with the extragrammaticality .
6402,3,R is a resolvant of F iff [ R is a resolved feature structure  _comma_
6403,5,The straightforward approach is to generalize existing recognition algorithms .
6404,3,SDL grammars are able to generate each context-free language and more than that .
6405,5,The structure is almost the same as Gunji 's structure except for explicitly showing complex proposition _comma_ subordinate-clause and conjunctive-particle that are newly added to deal with complex sentences .
6406,3,It can also be shown that R is completely determined once  is specified .
6407,3,The system is now utilized as a text browser for a prototypical interactive document retrieval system .
6408,3,First _comma_ the use of conceptual association not only enables a broad coverage _comma_ but also improves the accuracy .
6409,3,Next _comma_ we consider narrative progression in quantified contexts _comma_ as in sentence  .
6410,5,The effects of utterance actions are either assumed to always hold _comma_ or to hold as defaults unless the listener already believed otherwise .
6411,1,This paper presents an algorithm for tagging words whose part-of-speech properties are unknown .
6412,3,The data were recordings of telephone conversations between clients and an expert concerning problems with software .
6413,2,The problem with systems which impose co-operativity in the form of automatic goal adoption is that this makes it impossible to reason about cases in which one might want to violate these rules _comma_ especially in cases where the conversational co-operation might conflict with the agent 's personal goals .
6414,3,Preserving Information :
6415,2,Thus once something is popped off the stack its internal structure cannot be accessed by the coordination routine .
6416,3,The interlingua level reflects what is semantically common to expressions which form translational equivalents .
6417,3,The left-context neighborhood of `` onto '' reflects the fact that prepositional phrases are used in the same position as adverbs like `` away '' and `` together '' _comma_ thus making their left context similar .
6418,6,Since sentence boundaries provide information about word boundaries ( the end of a sentence is also the end of a word ) _comma_ our input contains sentence boundaries ; several studies Bernstein-Ratner 1985 _comma_ Hirsh-Pasek et al. 1987 _comma_ Kemler et al. 1989 _comma_ Jusczyk et al. 1992 have shown that infants can perceive sentence boundaries using prosodic cues .
6419,4,Yet _comma_ the aggregate probability of all these unseen bigrams is fairly high ; any new sample is very likely to contain some .
6420,4,for some permutation (  ) of 1_comma_2 _comma_ .. _comma_ n _comma_ where we let denote .
6421,3,We use the type hierarchy and an extension of the unification and generalization operations such that path annotations are preserved _comma_ to determine the flow of ( semantic ) information between the rules and the lexical entries in a grammar .
6422,3,Ellipsis interpretations are represented as simple sets of substitutions on semantic representations of the antecedent .
6423,3,As you will see later _comma_ this newly introduced role is playing a key role which bridges semantic roles of subordinate clause to semantic roles of main clause .
6424,3,How is such a rule converted into Prolog code by the LHIP system ?
6425,4,We see that an ` airline company ' can be the subject of verb ` fly ' ( the value of slot ` arg 1 ' ) _comma_ when the direct object ( the value of slot ` arg 2 ' ) is an ` airplane ' but not when it is an ` airline company ' .
6426,5,In a Dynamic Grammar Milward 1994a _comma_ each word is regarded as an action which performs some change in the syntactic and semantic context .
6427,3,Since the apprentice has no need to assert information to change the expert 's beliefs or to ask questions to verify the expert 's beliefs or to issue commands _comma_ we should not expect the apprentice to have control .
6428,4,In conversation _comma_ a person sometimes has to refer to an object that is not previously known to the other participant .
6429,5,We used the same set of origin words as for the distance vectors .
6430,3,This is why forms like danses-tu are tokenised as danses - and tu _comma_ and forms like chante-t-il are tokenised as chante-t - and il .
6431,3,Steedman 1990 also discusses `` generalized composition '' _comma_ and it may well be that a similar implementation is possible for that family of rules as well .
6432,3,We applied our method to estimate unseen bigram probabilities for Wall Street Journal text and compared it to the standard back-off model .
6433,3,Based on this observation _comma_ we can consider the constraints we have formulated for the tree system PLTG as constraints on a unification-based grammar formalism such as PATR .
6434,3,In both of these cases this evidence for conflict is given immediately .
6435,4,Nevertheless _comma_ there are many languages which have enough ambiguity that tagging is useful _comma_ but a rich enough tagset that the criteria on which it is designed must be given careful consideration .
6436,3,After a brief introduction to LFG _comma_ we isolate a class of models which obviously mirrors the composite nature of the LFG ontology _comma_ and then turn to the task of devising a language for talking about them .
6437,7,In this section we review this operation .
6438,3,However _comma_ if our goal is to specify large scale grammars in a clear _comma_ unambiguous manner _comma_ and to do so in such a way that our grammatical analyses are machine verifiable _comma_ then the use of formal specification languages has obvious advantages .
6439,3,On the basis of the input information in ( ENTITY OBJ ' ... ) it chooses a minimal syntactic structure from the inheritance net of the grammar _comma_ that just desribes a verb category without concrete filler ( a dummy verb ) plus a subject complement and active voice for the verbal phrase .
6440,3,There were four lexical items in the set _comma_ and they are duly organized to a sentence and  becomes a singleton .
6441,3,To make the task of determining countability and number simpler _comma_ we define combinations of different countabilities for nouns with different countability preferences that we can use in the dictionaries .
6442,2,However _comma_ there is a corresponding problem of far greater non-determinism _comma_ with even unambiguous words allowing many possible transitions .
6443,4,The left tree states a local syntactic dependency _comma_ i.e. the dominance relation between a root node and a set of leaf nodes and the linear precedence relation among the leaves .
6444,3,the search region for the first s clause is B-O ( i.e. from the start of the LHS search region to the start of the conjunction island ) _comma_ its island starts at D and covers T items ;
6445,2,Here the adverbial phrase would presumably be +MANNER _comma_ and the prepositional phrase _comma_ +TEMP .
6446,3,This research was partly funded by the Defence Research Agency _comma_ Malvern _comma_ UK _comma_ under Strategic Research Project M2YBT44X .
6447,4,On the other hand _comma_ while there may be many different affixes _comma_ their possibilities for combination within a word are fairly limited _comma_ so dimension  is quite manageable .
6448,2,If a grammar is augmented with operations which are powerful enough to make most initial fragments constituents _comma_ then there may be unwanted interactions with the rest of the grammar ( examples of this in the case of CCG and the Lambek Calculus are given in Section  ) .
6449,2,This representation of mutual belief differs from the common representation in terms of an iterated conjunction Litman and Allen 1990 in that :
6450,3,At the rule extraction phase _comma_ three sets of word-guessing rules ( morphological prefix guessing rules _comma_ morphological suffix guessing rules and ending-guessing rules ) are extracted from the lexicon and cleaned from coincidental cases .
6451,5,Then the bigram estimate derived by cooccurrence smoothing is given by
6452,3,recall _comma_ the percent of all correct segmentation points that were actually found ; and
6453,1,In this paper _comma_ we have categorized several forms of ellipsis and event reference according to two features :
6454,3,In the near future _comma_ we expect to apply LHIP to a different problem _comma_ that of defining a restricted language for specialized parsing .
6455,3,The parser was tested using sixteen sentences containing verbs for which data had been collected from the Penn Treebank corpus .
6456,5,The values of mutual information and thresholds for all node pairs are shown in Table  .
6457,3,Achieving understanding and compensating for resource bounds are issues for a model of dialogue whether or not agents are autonomous .
6458,5,A generation phase which imposes an order on the bag of target signs which is guaranteed grammatical according to the monolingual target grammar .
6459,3,In this DRS _comma_ n denotes the utterance time .
6460,3,I argue that although the overall performance of these models for German is comparable to results for English and French _comma_ a more exact analysis demonstrates important differences in the types of disambiguation involved for German .
6461,3,This would require even more data and thus the problem of how to collect sufficient data would be a crucial issue _comma_ in addition to the methodology of learning case frame patterns as probabilistic dependency graphs .
6462,3,This technique addresses as follows the three drawbacks just alluded to .
6463,3,Also _comma_ the declarative nature of  -Prolog programs opens up the possibility for applications of program transformations such as partial evaluation .
6464,7,Off-line compilation ( section  ) is used to produce grammars for the Earley-style generator ( section ) .
6465,3,Sanctioned non-coverage means that some number of special ` ignore ' rules have been applied which simulate coverage of input material lying between the islands _comma_ thus in effect making the islands contiguous .
6466,3,evaluating the contribution of false positives and error chaining .
6467,3,F is a satisfiable feature structure iff [ F is a feature structure _comma_ and
6468,3,In the first two domains _comma_ we created the training and test data artificially so as to have an ideal grammar in hand to benchmark results .
6469,3,The derived structures indicate that initiative plays a role in the structuring of discourse .
6470,3,A second reason for this is that the number of states visited will decrease with increasing reduction length .
6471,3,Finally _comma_ we take zoomin _comma_ the link between c-structure and f-structure information _comma_ to be a partial function from T to W .
6472,3,In this study explicit criteria are given : we then go on to analyse the relation between cues and this structure .
6473,3,Some of the problems with categorial grammar accounts of coordination do reoccur with a dynamic account based on the parser used in Milward 1992 .
6474,2,Traditional dialectological methodology gives little guidance as to how to perform such reduction to one dimension .
6475,3,Figure  is an example of a segment of a possible input proof _comma_ where some nodes are labeled for convenience .
6476,3,A second possibility is to take into account negative evidence : if  is frequent _comma_ but never followed it _comma_ there may be enough statistical evidence to put an upper bound on the estimate of .
6477,3,For the lexical sequence cher + e + _comma_ for example _comma_ the output is as follows .
6478,3,Moving horizontally across the table _comma_ one notices a change in vowel melody ( active { a } _comma_ passive { ui } ) ; everything else remains invariant .
6479,2,The limitations of the parsing approaches become evident when we consider grammars with left recursion .
6480,3,`` To prove Q _comma_ let us first prove  _comma_ and consider the two cases separately . ''
6481,3,Target clauses in gapping constructions are therefore represented with the overt constituents fronted out of an elided sentence node ; for instance the representation of the target clause in example  is shown in Figure ( the empty node is indicated by ) .
6482,3,In particular _comma_ LR parsers _comma_ like any other parsers employing a bottom-up parsing strategy _comma_ do not blend well with empty productions .
6483,3,Lexical items and phrases such as cue words ( stored in CUE_WORD ) affect the value of this slot .
6484,3,Finally _comma_ I wish to thank the anonymous reviewers for their comments .
6485,2,Clearly this would make the processing of text a very expensive operation .
6486,3,A second way of evaluating the performance of the abstraction process is to manually diagnose the reasons that have made the system to deduce the SRs obtained .
6487,3,The resulting system is sufficiently restricted in cases where other approaches overgenerate ; the very property of resource-sensitivity for which resource sharing appears to be problematic actually provides explanatory advantages over systems that more freely replicate resources during derivation .
6488,6,CUG ( Categorial Unification Grammar ) Uszkoreit 1986 is advantageous _comma_ compared to other phrase structure grammars _comma_ for parallel architecture _comma_ because we can regard categories as functional types and we can represent grammar rules locally .
6489,3,We believe that people have a much more complex set of motivations for action .
6490,1,We introduce the bilingual dual-coding theory as a model for bilingual mental representation .
6491,3,We would like to thank Don Hindle for making available the 1988 Associated Press verb-object data set _comma_ the Fidditch parser and a verb-object structure filter _comma_ Mats Rooth for selecting the objects of `` fire '' data set and many discussions _comma_ David Yarowsky for help with his stemming and concordancing tools _comma_ and Ido Dagan for suggesting ways of testing cluster models .
6492,4,For instance _comma_ the Japanese compound noun `` SinGataKansetuZei '' ( new indirect tax ) _comma_ produces  segementations possibilities for this case ( by consulting a Japanese dictionary _comma_ we would filter out some ) .
6493,3,For expository reasons _comma_ though _comma_ they are presented merely on the basis of examples of generation .
6494,3,This _comma_ actually _comma_ results in about 2 % higher accuracy of tagging on unknown words .
6495,3,The categories of the grammar are defined as follows :
6496,5,CCG is a grammatical formalism in which there is a one-to-one correspondence between the rules of composition at the level of syntax and logical form .
6497,3,In a strongly co-operative domain _comma_ such as TRAINS _comma_ the system can subordinate working on its own goals to locally working on concerns of the user _comma_ without necessarily having to have any shared discourse plan .
6498,7,We shall discuss this in more detail in section  .
6499,5,In Fig.  _comma_ Sub-Clause and Conjunct mean subordinate clause and conjunctive particle respectively .
6500,3,Using linear interpolation we get
6501,3,If neither training corpus nor lexicon are available _comma_ use BW re-estimation with standard convergence tests such as perplexity .
6502,3,It consists of a total of 42 POS tags plus three tags for punctuation and a special tag for truncated words .
6503,5,It differs from Prolog in that first-order terms and unification are replaced with simply-typed  - terms and higher-order unification _comma_ respectively .
6504,3,Different NLP systems will deal with the syntax and semantics of phenomena such as left - and right-extraposition in different ways .
6505,6,In this sense _comma_ it is similar to the local organization techniques used in Sibun 1990 .
6506,3,In both cases _comma_ very few of the unknown words ( less than 1 % ) had more than one tag .
6507,3,It is not really possible to say from these results how successful the whole approach of probabilistic principle-based parsing would be if it were fully implemented .
6508,3,Punctuation marks are counted as words _comma_ formulae as 1 word .
6509,3,Categories are sets of feature value equations containing syntactic information relevant to determining how uninstantiated meta-variables can be resolved .
6510,5,Incremental interpretation can then be achieved using a standard bottom-up shift reduce parser _comma_ working from left to right along the sentence .
6511,3,It is assumed that the input string is represented by the trans/3 predicate .
6512,3,Therefore _comma_ lower values for k ( and also for t ) are computationally preferable .
6513,3,This approach still allows us to encode salience in a hierarchy _comma_ but it is dependent on the referent .
6514,3,First _comma_ we evaluated the guessing rules against the actual lexicon : every word from the lexicon _comma_ except for closed-class words and words shorter than five characters _comma_ was guessed by the different guessing strategies and the results were compared with the information the word had in the lexicon .
6515,5,For n-gram models _comma_ we tried  for each domain .
6516,3,In fact _comma_ this is not so .
6517,7,Then we show the model of membrane interaction model with the example of Japanese causative sentence that requires drastic change of domination of cases .
6518,4,In this case _comma_ we have two remaining possibilities : `` Sin ( new ) / Gata ( type ) / Kansetu ( indirect ) / Zei ( tax ) '' and `` SinGata ( new ) / Kansetu ( indirect ) / Zei ( tax ) '' .
6519,7,Next the process of actually determining noun phrase countability and number is described .
6520,3,Here we want to stress that our primary task was not to evaluate the taggers themselves but rather their performance with the word-guessing modules .
6521,3,In addition _comma_ for each judgment _comma_ the judge was required to provide a confidence value for this decision _comma_ ranging from 0 ( not at all confident ) to 4 ( highly confident ) .
6522,3,One thus merges the category information from source and antecedent to determine what verb phrase form should be substituted for the original .
6523,3,in conjunction with other constraints or
6524,3,However _comma_ the interpretation of these terms must necessarily be different from the standard interpretation _comma_ since I have shown that the standard interpretation is not compatible with the present model .
6525,5,For each domain _comma_ we tried  .
6526,3,This is fine as far as it goes _comma_ but it isn't worth very much unless we spell out the conditions under which this relationship holds .
6527,3,The function of the network is briefly explained _comma_ and results are given .
6528,3,The anaphora module is called again to resolve the anaphoric pronoun its _comma_ which is possible _comma_ in this example _comma_ since the previous PPs have been attached and there is no anaphors before .
6529,3,Second _comma_ we have modeled features as partial functions on the f-structure nodes - this ensures that any complex valued attribute is either undefined _comma_ or is associated with a unique sub-part of the current f-structure .
6530,3,( In other words _comma_ the part of the f-structure that is associated with the VP node is re-entrant with that part of the f-structure which is associated with the S node . )
6531,2,However _comma_ this estimates the probability of any unseen bigram to be zero _comma_ which is clearly undesirable .
6532,4,The distribution of VP-ellipsis has also been shown to be sensitive to the coherence relationship extant between the source and target clauses _comma_ but in a different respect .
6533,3,The increased frequency of summaries in the ADs may result from the fact that the participants start with discrepant mutual beliefs about the situation and that establishing and maintaining mutual beliefs is a key part of the ADs .
6534,2,However _comma_ the lack of top-down guidance will lead _comma_ in general _comma_ to a lot of non-determinism .
6535,7,The paper is organised as follows .
6536,3,S is a total function from U to
6537,3,Our claim now is that a given 3-Partition problem  is solvable if and only if is in .
6538,5,Within this framework _comma_ it is perfectly easy to deal with cases like  by allowing the relative pronoun to add the expression to the quantifier store _comma_ annotated to specify that this expression has maximal scope .
6539,3,The simplest of these is where the type of argument expected by the state is matched by the next word i.e.
6540,5,Some early attempts at vector representation in psycholinguistics were the semantic differential approach Osgood et al. 1957 and the associative distribution approach Deese 1962 .
6541,7,Before proceeding _comma_ I will first examine some fashionable distinctions in section  in order to clarify the issues involved in comparing these approaches .
6542,3,There is both synchronic Ross 1972 and diachronic Tabor 1994 evidence suggesting that words and their uses can inherit properties from several prototypical syntactic categories .
6543,5,The phrasal coordination schema requires each conjunct to be given a single type _comma_ and for the conjuncts and the conjunction as a whole to be of the same type .
6544,2,Still _comma_ a lexicon is needed that specifies the possible parts of speech for every word .
6545,3,It has proved reasonable to assume that the coverage is monotone on both sides of some maximum _comma_ which simplifies this task considerably .
6546,5,If the recipient finds the initial referring expression plan invalid _comma_ then the agents will collaborate in its repair .
6547,2,Nor does it take into account generalizations about translation that are independent of the exact word order in source and target sentences .
6548,3,So we did not worry too much about tuning the taggers for the texts and used the Brown Corpus model instead .
6549,1,Work described in this paper started from an idea of an error processor that would sit on top of an editor _comma_ detecting / correcting errors just after entry _comma_ while the user continued with further text _comma_ relieved from tedious backtracking .
6550,5,This problem has been previously analyzed in de Swart 1991 as an instance of the proportion problem _comma_ and given a solution from a Generalized Quantifier approach .
6551,6,Similarity-based models suggest an appealing approach for dealing with data sparseness .
6552,3,Note that in this tree the value of the feature g in  is
6553,3,Not unrelated to the study of genre is the study of readability which aims to categorize texts according to their suitability for assumed sets of assumed readers .
6554,3,There are two possible solutions for cat_2 as a result of the fact that the filtering resulting from the magic literal in rule  is too unspecific .
6555,3,A backup mechanism could then be provided which attempted a slower _comma_ but more complete _comma_ direct application of the rules for the rarer cases .
6556,3,Specific obligations arise from a variety of sources .
6557,3,CLOSED_THREADS : Threads no longer available for continuation .
6558,3,Both taggers implement the FB _comma_ Viterbi and BW algorithms .
6559,3,The main advantage of this approach is that it reduces temporal structure ambiguity without having to rely on detailed world knowledge postulates .
6560,3,Moreover _comma_ despite the fact that the training is performed on a particular lexicon and a particular corpus _comma_ the obtained guessing rules suppose to be domain and corpus independent and the only training-dependent feature is the tag-set in use .
6561,7,In this section we evaluate the performance of the methodology implemented :
6562,3,As for the technical papers _comma_ they were 60 % and 80 % respectively .
6563,3,Their number and countability are ideally determined by the properties of the referent .
6564,3,Though no feature structure algebra provides descriptions as expressive as those provided by a feature logic _comma_ using feature structures to describe objects profits from a large stock of available computational techniques to represent _comma_ test and process feature structures .
6565,7,Section  raises some open questions concerning the determination of parallelism between ellipsis and antecedent _comma_ and other issues .
6566,3,The problem with the physical situation indicates to the apprentice that the relevant beliefs are no longer shared .
6567,5,Notice _comma_ however _comma_ that the choice of back-off or interpolation is independent from the similarity model used .
6568,3,The unary modalities  _comma_ _comma_ _comma_ and and the variable arity modality give us access to the binary relations important in formulating LFG grammars .
6569,4,By iterating the algorithm with the same corpus _comma_ the parameters of the model can be made to converge on values which are locally optimal for the given text .
6570,4,Consider the following phrases :
6571,5,The interest has naturally focussed on top-down methods because they are at least to a certain degree goal-directed .
6572,5,In such a setting _comma_ initial transition and symbol biases are replaced by frequencies of tag sequences and tag instantiation from a relatively small pre-tagged corpus .
6573,3,Each decision sequence constructs a unique parse _comma_ and the parser selects the parse whose decision sequence yields the highest cumulative probability .
6574,2,Therefore _comma_ the HMM model may suggest an improper character sequence as a word .
6575,1,Work underway focuses on shallow processing : how far error detection and correction can proceed when the system purview is set to a stretch of text which does not admit complete sentential analysis .
6576,1,In this paper _comma_ we measure the potential roles of distribution _comma_ phonotactics and their combination using a computer-simulated learning algorithm ; the simulation is based on a bootstrapping model in which phonotactic knowledge is used to constrain the distributional analysis of speech samples .
6577,3,Our results indicate that our full integrated heuristic scheme for selecting the best parse out-performs the simple heuristic _comma_ that considers only the number of words skipped .
6578,3,A successful parse is achieved if the final state expects no more arguments .
6579,3,The pronoun its can not be resolved by the anaphora resolution module because it is preceded by unattached PPs ; its resolution is skipped .
6580,5,Syntagmatic similarity is based on co-occurrence data extracted from corpora Church and Hanks 1990 _comma_ definitions in dictionaries Wilks et al. 1989 _comma_ and so on .
6581,3,The anaphora-resolution and the topic-supplementation must also be realized in the analysis .
6582,1,Is there a way to build accurate distance matrices that minimize editorial decisions without discarding relevant data ?
6583,5,The resource-based approach to semantic composition in Lexical-Functional Grammar ( LFG ) obtains the interpretation for a phrase via a logical deduction _comma_ beginning with the interpretations of its parts as premises Dalrymple et al. 1993b .
6584,3,The first experiment concerned the effect of the initial conditions on the accuracy using Baum-Welch re-estimation .
6585,3,( with an equivalent vertical alignment _comma_ henceforth to be used in this paper _comma_ on the right ) .
6586,3,closed-class vs. noun ( a ) _comma_
6587,3,The control framework distinguishes instances in which a control shift is negotiated by the participants and instances where one participant seizes control .
6588,5,This means that  is contra-indexed with .
6589,3,Thus _comma_ supposing a suitable grammar _comma_ for the sentence John saw Mary and Mark saw them there would be analyses corresponding to the sentence itself _comma_ as well as John saw Mary _comma_ John saw Mark _comma_ John saw them _comma_ Mary saw them _comma_ Mary and Mark saw them _comma_ etc .
6590,3,Next we focus on verbal suffix garu .
6591,3,The re-estimation was allowed to run for ten iterations .
6592,5,include no optional information Moore and Paris 1993 .
6593,5,The reference time according to Reichenbach 1947 is determined either by context _comma_ or by temporal adverbials .
6594,3,The penalties of the different features are then combined into a single score using a linear combination .
6595,3,The algorithm is applied on the text sentence by sentence _comma_ i.e. the ambiguities of the previous sentences have already been considered ( resolved or not ) .
6596,1,The most important feature of this model is that hierarchical planning and unplanned spontaneous presentation are integrated in a uniform framework .
6597,1,The application of the control rules lets us derive domain-independent discourse structures .
6598,3,The preferred ranking is  shifting - 1 ( see figure ) .
6599,5,Many researchers have attempted several techniques to deal with extragrammatical sentences such as Augmented Transition Network ( ATN ) Kwasny and Sondheimer 1981 _comma_ network-based semantic grammar Hendrix 1977 _comma_ partial pattern matching Hayes and Mouradian 1981 _comma_ conceptual case frame Schank et al. 1980 _comma_ and multiple cooperating methods Hayes and Carbonell 1981 .
6600,6,Krifka 1993 has suggested that focus should be seen as a means of providing material for a range of semantic and pragmatic functions to work on _comma_ rather than as a specific semantic or pragmatic function itself .
6601,3,In fact we can afford to remain entirely agnostic about the means by which the HPSG grammar associates signs with linguistic strings _comma_ because all that we need in order to train our stochastic procedures is a corpus of signs which are known to be valid descriptions of strings .
6602,3,Therefore the proposed method translates it with the same number as the subject .
6603,3,For instance _comma_ if the word danses is derived from the expression danses-tu ( do you dance _comma_ lit. dance-you ) _comma_ then it can only be a verb reading .
6604,3,The kinds of non-linear effects common in Semitic languages _comma_ where vowel and consonant patterns are interpolated in words Kay 1987 _comma_ Kiraz 1994 could be treated efficiently by the mechanisms described here if it proved possible to define a representation that allowed the parts of an inflected word corresponding to the root to be separated fairly cleanly from the parts expressing the inflection .
6605,4,Are Irish _comma_ Manx _comma_ and Scottish Gaelic considered three separate languages for intrinsic linguistic reasons _comma_ or because they are spoken in different countries ?
6606,3,The pattern type of the vocalism clashes with the broken plural pattern that the root expects .
6607,3,The number of superfluous analyses can be reduced by imposing a local threshold level _comma_ of say 0.5 .
6608,3,Having made the move from trees to feature structures _comma_ we consider the possibility of re-entrancy in PLPATR .
6609,3,This state is no longer an atomic eventuality .
6610,3,Our method of hierarchical clustering of words based on the MDL principle is theoretically sound .
6611,3,The goals of the temporal component were to yield a detailed representation of the temporal structure of the discourse _comma_ taking into account the effect of tense _comma_ aspect and temporal expressions while at the same time minimising unnecessary ambiguity in the temporal structure .
6612,4,This paper is meant to be viewed as furthering the exploration of the utility of higher-order logic programming for computational linguistics Miller and Nadathur 1986 _comma_ Pareschi 1989 _comma_ Pereira 1990 .
6613,7,We start by reviewing the training and use of probabilistic context-free grammars ( PCFGs ) .
6614,1,In this paper we examine the usefulness of these distance vectors as semantic representations by comparing them with co-occurrence vectors .
6615,1,In this paper we have discussed how the lexicographical concept of lexical functions _comma_ introduced by Mel'cuk to describe collocations _comma_ can be used as an interlingual device in the machine translation of such structures .
6616,3,Tuples of compatible derived feature structures are stored in the compatibility array using exactly the same approach used to store feature structures in the main recognition array .
6617,5,The similarity model in cooccurrence smoothing is based on the intuition that the similarity between two words w and w ' can be measured by the confusion probability  that w ' can be substituted for w in an arbitrary context in the training corpus .
6618,3,This attentional hierarchy is used to make reference choices for inference methods and for previously presented intermediate conclusions .
6619,3,The output of each call is a set of CSs that represent the intermediate results exchanged between each call and on which both modules operate in turn .
6620,4,Methods for automatically classifying words according to their contexts of use have both scientific and practical interest .
6621,3,Alternatively _comma_ and more practically _comma_ it would be possible to define a similarity measure between bigrams as a function of similarities between corresponding words in them .
6622,3,If this is done recursion can be used to produce an unbounded number of unbounded _comma_ dependent branches .
6623,3,After some experimentation _comma_ the evaluation feature weights were set in the following way .
6624,3,Our qualitative and quantitative models have a similar overall structure and there are clear parallels between the factoring of logical constraints and statistical parameters _comma_ for example monolingual postulates and dependency parameters _comma_ bilingual postulates and translation parameters .
6625,3,Finally _comma_ we should note that doing evaluations such as this allows us to determine the GENERALITY of our approaches .
6626,3,This is evident in Figure  .
6627,5,Due to the lack of an accepted formalism for the specification of principle-based grammars _comma_ Crocker and Lewin 1992 define the declarative ` Proper Branch ' formalism _comma_ which can be used with a number of different parsing methods .
6628,1,The objective was to emphasise more than it has been done until now _comma_ the fact that PP attachment and anaphora resolution could interact in the same system in order to produce a complete conceptual analysis _comma_ instead of slowing down each other .
6629,3,If the table is viewed in terms of the major word classes of noun _comma_ verb _comma_ adjective _comma_ adverb _comma_ and closed-class forms _comma_ the following predominant ambiguity classes for English can be distinguished :
6630,3,where K is  ( this has been extracted from the displayed formula to get it inside the available space -- it is in fact part of that formula ) .
6631,4,Distinctions of this sort are usually found only in corpora such as Susanne which are parsed as well as tagged .
6632,1,How do children combine the information they perceive from different sources ?
6633,3,Computationally _comma_ the quantitative model lets us escape from the undecidability of logic-based reasoning .
6634,3,where  also depends on .
6635,3,The third utterance in this example has two interpretations which are both consistent with the centering rules and constraints .
6636,3,In such a case _comma_ linguistic heuristics will solve the problem .
6637,2,However _comma_ we extend the notion of strict and sloppy identity to deal with more than just pronouns .
6638,2,Statistical models for parsing need to consider many more features of a sentence than can be managed by n-gram modeling techniques and many more examples than a human can keep track of .
6639,3,In order to construct interpretations of the kinds of objects we are interested in _comma_ then _comma_ we have to start by looking at simple sentences .
6640,5,For a system to understand dialogues involving self-repairs such as those in  would seem to require either an ability to interpret incrementally _comma_ or the use of a grammar which includes self repair as a syntactic construction akin to non-constituent coordination ( the relationship between coordination and self-correction is noted by Levelt 1983 ) .
6641,3,A rule name is a Prolog term _comma_ and only rules and terminal items may act as heads within a rule body .
6642,3,The output from the net is a vector whose 2 elements _comma_ or nodes _comma_ represent `` correct '' and `` incorrect '' _comma_ `` yes '' and `` no '' - see Figure  .
6643,3,It addresses the representation of language for connectionist processing _comma_ and describes methods of constraining the problem size .
6644,2,However _comma_ structural parallelism is a consequence of our ordering the Cf list by grammatical function and the preference for continuing over retaining .
6645,3,Note that  specifies local tree admissibility ( thus obviating the need for rewrite rules ) _comma_ and _comma_ and work together to capture the effect of and .
6646,3,Hence _comma_ we can frame the search for G ' as a search with the objective function  _comma_ the likelihood of the training data multiplied by the prior probability of the grammar .
6647,3,The differences in ambiguity types of the models also have effects on the types of errors produced by the German model .
6648,3,The lexical selection approach discussed here has two advantages .
6649,3,For instance _comma_ frequently occurring modal verbs such as `` must '' are not distinguished by number in English _comma_ but they are in many other languages .
6650,3,( If there are no existing threads a new thread is started . )
6651,3,We expect that automatically learned values of parameters can upgrade the performance of the parser .
6652,3,Besides the word collocations information _comma_ we also use semantic knowledge _comma_ namely _comma_ a thesaurus .
6653,4,The right tree defines the relation among the semantic representation of the root and the semantic representations of the leaves .
6654,3,From a learning perspective _comma_ this problem falls somewhere in between unsupervised and supervised learning .
6655,5,Reyle 1993 developed an inference system for Underspecified Discourse Representation Structures ( UDRS 's ) _comma_ i.e. Discourse Representation Structures Kamp and Reyle 1993 which are underspecified with respect to scope .
6656,3,is a morph that R approximates .
6657,3,For instance _comma_ a main verb past tense introduces a new temporal entity t under the constraint prior-to ( t _comma_ t  ) .
6658,5,A PCFG is a four-tuple  _comma_ where W is a set of terminal symbols _comma_ N is a set of non-terminal symbols _comma_ is the starting symbol and R is a set of rules of the form _comma_ where is a string of terminals and non-terminals .
6659,3,closed-class vs. adjective ( numeral einen _comma_ einer ) _comma_
6660,3,This representation is interpreted as S-structure .
6661,3,We compared the two vector representations by using them for the following two semantic tasks .
6662,1,The disambiguation has been already described _comma_ and here we discuss the other stages of the process _comma_ namely the definition of the tagset _comma_ transforming a current lexicon into a new one and guessing the words that do not appear in the lexicon .
6663,3,It is also interesting that D3 + T1 does better than D2 + T1 .
6664,3,The KL distance is 0 when  _comma_ and it increases as the two distribution are less similar .
6665,3,The similarity is measured on a semantic network constructed systematically from a subset of the English dictionary _comma_ LDOCE ( Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English ) .
6666,3,There must be at least one word beyond the end of the subject and before the end-of-sentence mark .
6667,4,Although this construction shows that the intersection of a FSA and a CFG is itself a CFG _comma_ it is not of practical interest .
6668,5,A key part of this model is that some types of evidence provide better support for beliefs than other types .
6669,3,While the clusters derived by the proposed method seem in many cases semantically significant _comma_ this intuition needs to be grounded in a more rigorous assessment .
6670,3,Moving vertically _comma_ a change in canonical pattern occurs ; everything else remains invariant .
6671,3,There is a semantic restriction on the body of a rule which is that it must contain at least one clause which necessarily covers input ( optional clauses and ignore rules do not necessarily cover input ) .
6672,2,Second _comma_ various issues with regard to the interpretation of propositional representations are now rendered moot .
6673,4,Let us first consider some examples of self-repair .
6674,3,The similarity between words provides a new method for analysing the structure of text .
6675,3,When all training utterances have been incorporated _comma_ find all the triples   _comma_ such that but the probability of u is maximized by .
6676,1,We argue that aspects of both analyses are necessary to account for the recovery of temporal relations .
6677,3,When the lexicon is degraded ( D2 ) _comma_ the pattern is always classical .
6678,1,We address the problem of automatically constructing a thesaurus by clustering words based on corpus data .
6679,3,By using constraints and preferences _comma_ we can considerably reduce the amount of ambiguity in the temporal / rhetorical structure of a discourse .
6680,4,For example :
6681,3,The default preconditions of the rule characterize a situation where an object ( ) contains no information about the case but identifies the input category as ` N ' for noun .
6682,5,Moore 1989 suggests that the way to overcome this problem is to use explicit - terms and encode - reduction to perform the needed reduction .
6683,7,For this reason _comma_ we will review the concept of entropy at this point _comma_ and discuss its relation to perplexity .
6684,3,Find nodes  corresponds to ( ex. red { red_1 _comma_ red_2 } ) .
6685,5,Unconscious garden paths _comma_ on the other hand _comma_ such as  _comma_ cause reanalysis which is experimentally detectable _comma_ but which is generally not `` noticed '' by the speaker or hearer .
6686,7,The examples in Section  showed how you can combine these analyses of focus with a variety of operators to convey a range of interpretations of the same sequence of words .
6687,5,In addition _comma_ composition is only sensitive to the meanings of its components .
6688,3,The choice between the use of raced as the main verb _comma_ or as part of the reduced relative is usually assumed to be within the fragment the horse raced _comma_ suggesting that there are two distinguished parsing states after raced .
6689,3,It pays to stipulate that the structures which we build are fully inequated in the sense defined by Carpenter 1992 _comma_ p120 .
6690,3,This is equivalent to running the original GLR parser .
6691,3,Ascriptive noun phrases are used to ascribe a property to something ; for example ` Hathi is an elephant ' .
6692,3,We need to modify our algorithm to more aggressively model n-gram information .
6693,5,These are elements of a sentence that should be separated _comma_ as opposed to elements of constituents that cling together .
6694,3,There was a total of 56 shifts of control over the 4 dialogues and we identified 3 main classes of cues used to signal control shifts
6695,1,This paper will focus on  leaving for future work .
6696,4,Parallel and distributed computation is expected to be the main stream of information processing .
6697,3,For example _comma_ consider the well known example of garden pathing :
6698,5,Instead _comma_ processing is guided by the principle of Incremental Licensing _comma_ which states that `` the parser attempts incrementally to satisfy the principles of grammar '' .
6699,3,It is important to recover it using only syntactic information although results of recovery are better if semantic factors are considered .
6700,3,There is no appeal to any construction algorithm ; we have simply stated how we want the different pieces to fit together .
6701,3,It is difficult _comma_ if not impossible given currently available methods _comma_ to determine which sources of information are necessary for infants to segment speech and learn words ; only this sort of indirect evidence is available to us .
6702,5,This mixture of top-down and bottom-up information flow is crucial since the top-down semantic information from the goal category must be integrated with the bottom-up subcategorization information from the lexicon .
6703,3,In some occasions _comma_ if multiple verbs exist in one sentence _comma_ they may conflict as to which verb dominates which noun phrase .
6704,5,For example a speaker might use the expression `` so '' to signal that s / he is about to conclude what s / he has just said .
6705,4,Then it is not possible to estimate probabilities from observed frequencies _comma_ and some other estimation scheme has to be used .
6706,4,Now consider a situation where B is an autonomous agent Galliers 1991 .
6707,3,A instantiated to ( bs np s )
6708,4,To recognize normal state implicatures one must consider mutual beliefs and plans Green 1990 .
6709,5,The model description length quantifies the simplicity ( complexity ) of a model _comma_ and the data description length quantifies the fit to the data .
6710,3,Let  denote a set of words which are most similar to _comma_ as determined by some similarity metric .
6711,3,Generate rfr of each node in Paradigme _comma_ in the following way :
6712,3,Ignore rules have a similar functionality to that of normal rules .
6713,3,In fact _comma_ using this strategy one could see if the highest ranked proposal passed all the filters _comma_ or if the next highest did _comma_ etc .
6714,3,The essence of our approach is to define a stochastic procedure which simultaneously expands the nodes of the tree in the way outlined above and guesses the pattern of re-entrancies which relate them .
6715,3,As is the case for the tree sets of IG _comma_ LIG and Tree Adjoining Grammar _comma_ the tree sets generated by PLTG have path sets that are context-free languages .
6716,3,The first is word sense disambiguation ( WSD ) based on the similarity of context vectors ; the second is the learning of or meanings from example words .
6717,5,It thus differs from _comma_ say ATNs Woods 1973 _comma_ which have a finite number of states _comma_ augmented by an explicit recursion mechanism .
6718,3,For example a noun modified by onoono-no `` each '' is denumerated - singular _comma_ while one modified by ryouhou-no `` both '' is denumerated - plural .
6719,5,An Indexed Grammar ( IG ) can be viewed as a cfg in which each nonterminal is associated with a stack of indices .
6720,3,Therefore  .
6721,3,The quantitative model also reduced overall complexity in terms of the sets of symbols used .
6722,3,At the very least _comma_ this information can be applied in broad coverage parsing to assist in the control of search .
6723,2,Notice that this formula has the same form as our similarity model  _comma_ except that it uses confusion probabilities where we use normalized weights .
6724,3,Hence _comma_ she described the building as funny-looking .
6725,5,To illustrate this informally consider a case of inference from a number of examples : as they are presented to the inference machine _comma_ possible grammars are postulated .
6726,3,Preliminary tests used generated errors _comma_ from a program that produces random Damerau slips according to an observed distribution Pollock 1983 _comma_ using confusion matrices where appropriate Kernighan et al. 1990 .
6727,5,in arguing that the past perfect should not be treated as anaphoric :
6728,3,This process has now been improved by going further along the sentence .
6729,1,We extended this algorithm to recover extragrammatical sentence into grammatical one in running text .
6730,4,A second design criterion on tagsets is the internal one of making the tagging as effective as possible .
6731,7,We conclude by sketching a technique which does treat such structures .
6732,3,As for an observer introduced by garu _comma_ one of the widely known consequence about the nature of subjective predicate is the following .
6733,3,Parameters are set to reflect the frequency of the corresponding rule in the parsed corpus .
6734,3,These measurements must be made by doing comparisons at the data level .
6735,2,We argue that the resource sharing that is commonly manifest in semantic accounts of coordination is instead appropriately handled in terms of structure-sharing in LFG f-structures .
6736,7,considering the coverage of the WordNet taxonomy regarding the noun senses appearing in Treebank _comma_ and
6737,5,Clearly the rule does not hold .
6738,3,However _comma_ if a third sentence is added _comma_ an ambiguity results .
6739,5,Phrasal coordination is exemplified by the schema : X  X Conj X The shared material is necessarily treated identically for each conjunct since there is only a single copy : the conjunction is embedded in a single syntax tree .
6740,3,We want to distinguish between items that are unlikely to occur ever _comma_ and those that have just not happened to turn up in the training data .
6741,5,In Gunji 's structure _comma_ some node can have more than two daughter nodes to make more complex sentence .
6742,3,What I have argued is that almost any approach to these phenomena can be adapted to deal with focus as well .
6743,3,Obviously there is a trade-off between fluency and reliability : maximal reliability requires ` secure ' decisions and therefore leads to output delay .
6744,3,It is going to turn out that an exactly analogous system of accessibility relations is present in the probabilistic type hierarchies which we define later .
6745,4,In collaborative consultation dialogues _comma_ the consultant and the executing agent collaborate on developing a plan to achieve the executing agent 's domain goal .
6746,4,Thus the ability to ` subtract ' one type from another allows the Lambek Calculus to replicate a deletion account _comma_ and it thereby suffers from the same problems .
6747,3,A transition for  is ranked more highly if ; this state we call shifting - 1 and it represents a more coherent way to shift .
6748,5,We encounter  but it does not have an NP or S node between it and X .
6749,3,This information is used to generate the correct translation in the target language .
6750,3,Another example is connection strengths in neural network approaches to language processing _comma_ though it has been shown that certain networks are effectively computing probabilities Richard and Lippmann 1991 .
6751,3,First _comma_ when the subproof that has the structure of Figure  is the current presentation task _comma_ tested by ( task ) .
6752,2,For some applications _comma_ though _comma_ there is no obvious extrinsic basis for dividing the training corpus into clusters .
6753,3,In less co-operative situations _comma_ the same architecture will allow a system to still adhere to the conversational conventions _comma_ but respond in different ways _comma_ perhaps rejecting proposals and refusing to answer questions .
6754,3,In addition _comma_ we have taken a few steps towards determining the relative importance of different factors to the successful operation of discourse modules .
6755,3,a modal operator for talking about zoomin _comma_ together with a path equality construct for synchronising the information flow between the two domains .
6756,3,The choice is hypothesized to depend on cognitive properties of B _comma_ e.g. what B knows _comma_ B 's attentional state _comma_ and B 's processing capabilities _comma_ as well as properties of the task and the communication channel .
6757,4,partially vocalised texts incorporate some short vowels to clarify ambiguity _comma_ e.g.  kutb for /kutib/ to distinguish it from /katab/ ; and
6758,3,This necessitates a coherence relation that is consistent with this temporal order _comma_ in this case _comma_ Explanation .
6759,3,A functional approach is taken to tagging : words are allocated to classes depending on their syntactic role .
6760,3,The converted form of the above rule is given below ( minus the code for chart maintenance ) :
6761,2,This approach improves upon earlier work on discourse structure such as Lascarides and Asher 1991 and Kehler 1994a in reducing the number of possible ambiguities ; it is also more precise than the Kamp / Hinrichs / Partee approach in that it takes into account ways in which the apparent defaults can be overridden and differentiates between events and activities _comma_ which behave differently in narrative progression .
6762,3,We found that each source provided some useful information for speech segmentation _comma_ but the combination of sources provided substantial information .
6763,5,Notice _comma_ only the reason labeled as `` explicit '' is verbalized .
6764,1,This paper describes a method that extracts information relevant to countability and number from the Japanese text and combines it with knowledge about countability and number in English .
6765,3,describes a state and describes an activity .
6766,3,A common tag class was created for `` VBN '' and `` PRD '' to show that they are reasonably well distinguished from other parts of speech _comma_ even if not from each other .
6767,3,This system generates sets of tag strings for each sentence _comma_ with the hypertags placed in all possible positions .
6768,1,The SPATTER parser illustrates how large amounts of contextual information can be incorporated into a statistical model for parsing by applying decision-tree learning algorithms to a large annotated corpus .
6769,3,In each case _comma_ I give the source of the noun grouping _comma_ the grouping itself _comma_ and for each word a description of word senses together with their values of  .
6770,3,At the scoring phase _comma_ each rule is scored in accordance with its accuracy of guessing and the best scored rules are included into the final rule-sets .
6771,3,The results of this tagging are summarised in Table  .
6772,1,In this paper _comma_ we discuss the interaction of temporal anaphora and quantification over eventualities .
6773,4,Thus there is a trade-off between the simplicity of a model and the goodness of fit to data .
6774,5,Volume 1 of Wagner 1958 consists of 300 maps _comma_ plotting about 370 concepts .
6775,3,The debugging tools help in checking the operation of the spelling rules _comma_ either
6776,5,We recently developed word vectors that are derived from an ordinary dictionary by measuring the inter-word distances in the word definitions Niwa and Nitta 1993 .
6777,5,However _comma_ collocations are not only considered useful _comma_ but also a problem both in certain applications ( e.g. generation _comma_ Nirenburg et al. 1988 _comma_ machine translation _comma_ Heid and Raab 1989 ) and from a more theoretical point of view Abeille and Schabes 1989 _comma_ Krenn and Erbach To appear .
6778,3,These 51 concepts were represented by 312 different Gaelic words or phrases _comma_ whose stems derived from 171 different etymons .
6779,3,We store semantic patterns between words as a cheap and quick form of world knowledge ; these patterns are easier to provide than are the detailed world knowledge postulates required in some other approaches _comma_ and result in similar and sometimes more precise temporal structures with less processing overhead .
6780,3,Consider the nominal data in  .
6781,5,We earlier described two taggers for French _comma_ a statistical one and a constraint-based one .
6782,3,Application to the right is defined by the rule :
6783,3,We also evaluated in detail whether a conjunctive application with the Xerox guesser would boost the performance .
6784,3,In sentence  _comma_ the location time of the event in the main clause is restricted to fall ( just ) after the event time of the event of the subordinate clause .
6785,3,if  is a wff then so is _comma_ where and
6786,5,Figure  shows the representations for the sentence Bill became upset ; this will serve as the initial source clause representation for the examples that follow .
6787,3,Corresponding to the linearity restriction in LIG we require that any part of the mother 's tree is passed to at most one daughter .
6788,3,Further _comma_ it cannot be assumed that the lexicon has been fully specified when the morphology rules are compiled .
6789,3,The multiple use of semantic contributions results from viewing dependencies in f-structures as resources ; in this way the one-to-one correspondence between f-structure relations and meanings is maintained .
6790,3,has only one antecedent .
6791,4,When we describe a motion _comma_ the fact to choose a verb instead of another _comma_ a preposition instead of another _comma_ a syntactic structure instead of another _comma_ reveals our mental cognitive representation .
6792,3,We refer to the vector of left neighbors of a word as its left context vector _comma_ and to the vector of right neighbors as its right context vector .
6793,3,If present _comma_ this value defines the local threshold fraction for that rule .
6794,3,We do not wish to define the sets of terminal and non-terminal symbols explicitly _comma_ these can be understood from the rules that are defined using the relation rule/2 _comma_ and where symbols of the rhs are prefixed with ` - ' in the case of terminals and ` + ' in the case of non-terminals .
6795,3,The second consequence of the MP for only says that there is no other category of item which satisfies the abstraction -- that the only thing I borrowed was a car .
6796,3,In other words _comma_ semantic roles that appear in subordinate clause and semantic roles that appear in the main clause seem to be directly constrained by the constraints of complex sentence .
6797,1,The purpose of our paper is to develop a principled technique for attaching a probabilistic interpretation to feature structures .
6798,2,However _comma_ our research did not specify _comma_ in cases where multiple conflicts arise _comma_ how an agent should identify which part of an unaccepted proposal to address or how to select evidence to support the proposed modification .
6799,5,The mapped entries are presented in a very narrow phonetic transcription based on the International Phonetic Alphabet .
6800,4,The ( tactical ) generation problem is the task to generate a string from a semantic representation according to the syntax-semantics-relation defined in a given grammar .
6801,3,Theorem 27 .
6802,3,This second batch of examples is particularly difficult to exclude without making changes to the characterisation of the states .
6803,5,Function composition enables a function to be applied to its argument _comma_ even if that argument is incomplete e.g.
6804,3,The rule required is similar to Function Composition in CG i.e.
6805,3,For instance vient-il ( does he come _comma_ lit. comes-he ) is analysed as :
6806,3,While in English and French a fair number of disambiguations involve separating major POS classes such as verb _comma_ noun _comma_ and adjective _comma_ most of the work performed in the German model involves disambiguation between subclasses of one main category _comma_ such as finite vs. infinitive verb _comma_ noun vs. proper noun _comma_ different sub-categories of pronouns _comma_ etc .
6807,5,In order that `` improbabilities '' can be modelled by inhibitory connections Niles and Silverman 1990 show how a Hidden Markov Model can be implemented by a neural network .
6808,3,For example the logical omniscience assumption would mean that if  and below are in the context _comma_ then will be as well since it is entailed from and .
6809,3,The comparison of the most frequent ambiguity types shows a significant difference between the German model on the one hand and the English and French models on the other .
6810,5,But as the dialectometrists have shown _comma_ other notions of clustering are equally scientific and may more accurately correspond to intuitive notions of what it means to be a dialect .
6811,3,However _comma_ the German model was useful for the project because a tagged reference corpus was required for lexicographic work in order to adapt existing bilingual dictionaries .
6812,3,The eventualities described by the perfect of a verb refer to the consequent state of its nucleus .
6813,7,In this section we will first discuss the relative importance of various factors that go into producing the numbers above _comma_ then discuss if the algorithms can be modified since the flexibility of a framework in allowing one to make modifications is an important dimension of evaluation .
6814,7,The following paragraphs describe these components in more detail .
6815,3,Differences in performance between the Explicit-Warrant strategy and the All-Implicit strategy are shown via a DIFFERENCE PLOT such as figure  .
6816,3,The approach is applicable with only a minor modification to N-grams for N > 1 : the probability of a word within a cluster is conditioned on the occurrence of the N - 1 words preceding it _comma_ and the entropy calculations take this into account .
6817,7,We present our analysis in the next section _comma_ and account for these facts in Section  .
6818,3,I would like to thank Stuart Shieber and Barbara Grosz for valuable discussions and comments on earlier drafts .
6819,7,In section  we describe it while discussing other approaches .
6820,5,Ribas 1994b performed some experiments using this basic technique and drew up some limitations from the corresponding results .
6821,3,These 134 tags are then mapped onto the small customised tagsets .
6822,3,The method used here is a new experimental methodology for computational linguistics that supports testing hypotheses about beneficial discourse strategies Carletta 1992 _comma_ Pollack and Ringuette 1990 .
6823,2,At best _comma_ isoglosses for different features approach each other _comma_ forming vague bundles ; at worst _comma_ isoglosses may cut across each other _comma_ describing completely contradictory binary divisions of the dialect area .
6824,5,Decision-tree classification algorithms account for both of these tasks _comma_ and they also accomplish a third task which grammarians classically find difficult .
6825,3,Firstly _comma_ two of the tests _comma_ D2 + T1 and D3 + T1 _comma_ give very poor performance .
6826,3,Clearly _comma_ the event described by the past perfect sentence must precede the event described by the first _comma_ simple past sentence .
6827,3,Our definitions are given with respect to a signature of the form  _comma_ where Cat _comma_ Atom and Feat are non-empty _comma_ finite or denumerably infinite sets .
6828,1,This paper will focus on our temporal processing algorithm _comma_ and in particular on our analysis of narrative progression _comma_ rhetorical structure _comma_ perfects and temporal expressions .
6829,5,The parse trees are implicit in the sense that each node in the tree is the ( mnemonic ) name of the grammar rule resolved on at that point _comma_ rather than the syntactic category of the LHS of the grammar rule as is the case in an ordinary parse tree .
6830,2,However _comma_ by considering grammaticality judgements alone _comma_ there seems little justification for such a division .
6831,5,Dynamic semantics adopts the view that `` the meaning of a sentence does not lie in its truth conditions _comma_ but rather in the way in which it changes ( the representation of ) the information of the interpreter '' Groenendijk and Stokhof 1991 .
6832,3,For the control phases _comma_ we found that three types of utterances ( prompts _comma_ repetitions and summaries ) were consistently used to signal control shifts .
6833,2,However _comma_ on-line semantic filtering for sentence processing does have drawbacks .
6834,1,This article addresses the problem of automating this process and presents a method where the nodes to cut at are selected automatically using the information-theoretical concept of entropy .
6835,5,In the latter work _comma_ McCandless uses a heuristic search procedure similar to ours _comma_ but a very different search criteria .
6836,3,Using rule  only _comma_ we can obviously prove .
6837,3,And as with an ordinary DCG formalism _comma_ it is possible to apply different parsing methods to LHIP in order to circumvent these problems Pereira and Shieber 1987 .
6838,3,describes an event and describes an atelic or a simple tense state _comma_ or
6839,3,For each entry  in Glossme _comma_ map each unit in onto a subrfrant of the corresponding node in Paradigme .
6840,3,We hope that this architecture is also of general interest beyond this particular application .
6841,3,Having the grammatical words and the alphabet of each language at its disposal _comma_ the system computes for each of them its likelihood to be selected .
6842,3,Although the model can be trained without initial biases _comma_ the performance of the resulting model increases significantly if appropriate initial biases are used .
6843,4,This can be seen in the following portion of a telephone conversation recorded by Psathas 1991 _comma_ p. 196 .
6844,3,The main findings of this paper can be extended to other members of that family of constraint-based grammar formalisms .
6845,3,We are grateful to Peter Heeman _comma_ Graeme Hirst _comma_ and Jeffrey Siskind for many helpful discussions .
6846,3,The rules have been implemented to generate the translation that has the widest application _comma_ for example generating ` I ate too much cake ' _comma_ which is true whether the speaker only ate part or all of one cake or if they ate many cakes _comma_ rather than ` I ate too many cakes ' which is only true if the speaker ate many cakes .
6847,3,Because we have not yet treated the crucial matter of re-entrancy _comma_ it would be inappropriate to call what we so far have stochastic HPSG _comma_ so we refer to it as stochastic  .
6848,3,We inductively define a three place relation  which holds between models _comma_ nodes n and wffs .
6849,5,Other strategies tested in Design-World are presented elsewhere Walker 1993 _comma_ Walker 1994a _comma_ Rambow and Walker 1994 .
6850,3,An axiom for interpretation provides the links between meanings of path sets related by R-relations .
6851,3,A complementary correction strategy for morphologically sound but morphosyntactically ill-formed words is outlined .
6852,3,Then _comma_ normalize thickness of the links as  _comma_ in each .
6853,5,The elements of the verbal system are logogens for words in a language .
6854,5,Pereira et al. 1993 propose a `` soft '' clustering scheme for certain grammatical cooccurrences in which membership of a word in a class is probabilistic .
6855,3,The remainder of the discussion is presented in terms of bigrams _comma_ but it is valid for other types of word cooccurrence as well .
6856,3,When prior intentions and obligations conflict _comma_ an agent generally will delay pursuit of its intentions in order to satisfy the obligations _comma_ although the agent may behave otherwise at the cost of violating its obligations .
6857,3,Our model uses phonotactic constraints as absolute requirements on the structure of individual words ; this implies that phonotactics have been learned prior to attempts at segmentation .
6858,1,However _comma_ in this paper we focus only in selectional restrictions holding between verbs and their complements .
6859,5,the SYSCONJ system separately parses Peter a paper about subjacency and Mary a book about subjacency before conjoining at the level of some enclosing constituent ( for example the verb phase ) .
6860,5,( ' empty ' semantics is represented by the empty list symbol [] ) :
6861,4,Similarity between words can be defined by either a syntagmatic or a paradigmatic relation .
6862,3,The majority of symbol biases were added to correct misguided biases chosen during the training processes .
6863,3,The tests are processed in the order shown .
6864,3,Note that countable indefinite singular noun phrases without a determiner will have a / an generated .
6865,2,This model 's performance is compared with two other German taggers with partial parameter re-estimation and full adaption of parameters from pre-tagged corpora .
6866,5,IRUs that make inferences explicit can help inference limited agents perform as well as logically omniscient ones Walker 1993 .
6867,3,Both of these properties of MDL are empirically verified in our present context _comma_ as will be shown in the next section .
6868,5,However _comma_ the new category X  Y is used to ensure that both categories are appropriate in the context .
6869,7,First countability in English is discussed at the noun phrase and then the noun level .
6870,3,Since  is computable _comma_ for some effective function _comma_ for each finite _comma_ a list of the total functions from Q to _comma_ for some effective function _comma_ for each finite set Q _comma_ each finite partial function from the Cartesian product of Q and to Q _comma_ and each total function from Q to _comma_ if for each in the domain of _comma_ is defined _comma_ and then ` true ' otherwise ` false ' _comma_ and for some effective function _comma_ for each finite set Q _comma_ each total function from Q to and each total function from Q to _comma_ if for each _comma_ then ` true ' otherwise ` false ' .
6871,5,Every element of  must be realized in .
6872,3,Since an observer observes the situation which is characterized by a soa _comma_ if we know that there exists an observer _comma_ the observed soa is embedded in observing situation _comma_ which _comma_ in turn _comma_ is embedded in the whole semantic content .
6873,3,The inflexibility of text currently produced is partly inherited from the schemata-based approach _comma_ for which a fine-grained planning in terms of single PCAs might be a remedy .
6874,3,Obligations represent what an agent should do _comma_ according to some set of norms .
6875,7,In this section _comma_ at first we show the predicate categories used in the subordinate clauses that we deal with in this paper _comma_ in Table  .
6876,1,A comparison was made of vectors derived by using ordinary co-occurrence statistics from large text corpora and of vectors derived by measuring the inter-word distances in dictionary definitions .
6877,3,The result of the plan is the surface speech action _comma_ s-suggest _comma_ that communicates the suggestion .
6878,3,We are planning to explore `` soft '' classification algorithms that can account for these phenomena .
6879,3,The value of focus is the focussed item itself .
6880,3,To calculate the probability that a string of words  _comma_ _comma_ _comma_ ... has the parse represented by the string of category-states S _comma_ S _comma_ S _comma_ ... S _comma_ we simply take the product of the probability of each transition : ie. .
6881,3,At the merging phase _comma_ rules which have not scored high enough to be included into the final rule-sets are merged into more general rules _comma_ then re-scored and depending on their score added to the final rule-sets .
6882,5,Generation succeeds if all the leaves of the syntax tree are labeled with terminals and no link markings exist (rule global-success ) .
6883,3,Table  looks at results for `` natural '' contexts _comma_ i.e. those not containing punctuation marks and rare words .
6884,3,This smoothing appears to compensate for inaccuracies in  _comma_ mainly for infrequent conditioning words .
6885,3,We plan to follow up the current work by training and testing a suitable instantiation of our framework against manually annotated corpora .
6886,4,In statistical natural language processing _comma_ usually the number of parameters in a probabilistic model to be estimated is very large _comma_ and therefore such a model is difficult to estimate with a reasonable data size that is available in practice .
6887,5,At the point where John knows the truth has been processed _comma_ a complete clause will have been built :
6888,4,However _comma_ static language modeling performance has remained basically unchanged since the advent of n-gram language models forty years ago Shannon 1951 .
6889,3,The implementation consists of five modules :
6890,5,It is worth noting that the difficulties in trying to combine eliminative semantics with left-to-right threading apply to constraint-based semantics as well as to Update Semantics .
6891,3,Our longer-term goal _comma_ however _comma_ is to apply similarity techniques to linguistically motivated word cooccurrence configurations _comma_ as suggested by lexicalized approaches to parsing Schabes 1992 _comma_ Lafferty et al. 1992 .
6892,4,A text is not just a sequence of words _comma_ but it also has coherent structure .
6893,3,Indeed _comma_ lexical informations can be used to disambiguate the structure of the discours _comma_ as well as discourse relations can be used to disambiguate lexical entries _comma_ as shown in Asher and Sablayrolles 1994b .
6894,1,We have presented two proposals for the association of probabilities with typed feature-structures of the form used in HPSG .
6895,3,The linear logic operator ` ! ' allows the conclusion  to be used as many times as necessary : once for each R-relation R ( F _comma_ P _comma_ G ) introduced by the f-structure .
6896,3,The crucial data structure that it employs is the TNCB .
6897,2,However _comma_ a different prior probability on grammars is used _comma_ and the algorithms are only efficient enough to be applied to small data sets .
6898,5,We traverse  to the left of p .
6899,3,Succeeds if Seq is a sequence of one or more parses of S by C such that they are non-overlapping and each consumes input that precedes that consumed by the next .
6900,4,Natural language generation must work with insufficient input .
6901,5,For example _comma_ an adverb such as slowly could be given the type
6902,5,A factor in the objective function that favors smaller grammars over large can prevent the objective function from preferring grammars that overfit the training data .
6903,5,This technique has an advantage that there is no repeating work for the chart to prevent the parser from generating the same edge as the previously existed edge .
6904,3,These are homographs in German that are notoriously hard to disambiguate within a narrow context .
6905,4,Figure  illustrates this proof-logical behaviour .
6906,3,On the one hand _comma_ 235 ( 8.8 % ) of these triples were considered to be extracted erroneously because of the parser _comma_ and 51 ( 1.9 % ) because of the lemmatizer .
6907,3,We gathered about three thousand words from the lexicon developed for the Wall Street Journal corpus and collected frequencies of these words in this corpus .
6908,4,says that I did steal something which belongs to you _comma_ says that I stole somebody 's car _comma_ but not yours _comma_ and says that I did do something to your car ( I probably borrowed it _comma_ though that is not entailed by ) .
6909,4,Unless a keyboard user is particularly proficient _comma_ a frustrating amount of time is usually spent backtracking to pick up mis-typed or otherwise mistaken input .
6910,3,Although many of the classes acquired result from the accumulation of incorrect senses ( 73.3 % ) _comma_ it seems that their size tends to be smaller than classes in other categories _comma_ as they only contain a 51.4 % of the senses .
6911,4,Generally speaking _comma_ default handling specifies how processing _comma_ i.e. _comma_ further decision-making _comma_ can continue without sufficient input information .
6912,3,The second says that I didn't do anything else to it .
6913,1,Finally _comma_ it shows how processing accounts can be described formally and declaratively in terms of Dynamic Grammars .
6914,3,Obviously _comma_ a bottom-up component is required .
6915,5,In this definition R acts as a specification of the accessibility relationships which can hold between nodes of the trees admitted by the grammar .
6916,5,A proper branch is a set of three nodes -- a mother and two daughters -- which are constructed by the parser _comma_ using a simple mechanism such as a shift-reduce interpreter _comma_ and then ` licensed ' by the principles of grammar .
6917,3,Firstly _comma_ there is nothing equivalent to a stack mechanism : at all times the state is characterised by a single syntactic type _comma_ and a single semantic value _comma_ not by some stack of semantic values or syntax trees which are waiting to be connected together .
6918,3,Using constraints _comma_ we reduce the number of readings to 4 .
6919,3,These noun phrases cannot be generated correctly by the purely heuristic methods proposed here .
6920,2,A strict left-to-right _comma_ depth-first expansion of subgoals might run into problems with the grammar fragment in  if a left-recursive np-rule exists _comma_ because the semantics of the np is only instantiated once the 'semantic head ' of the vp has been looked up in the lexicon .
6921,3,In this light _comma_ it is not surprising that the word-type method does better on cardinals .
6922,3,For case  _comma_ the user may ask to see all inflections of a root licensed by the spelling rules _comma_ production rules _comma_ and lexicon ; for cher _comma_ the output is
6923,3,A model is a tripartite structure  _comma_ where is our mathematical picture of c - structure _comma_ our picture of f-structure _comma_ and zoomin our picture of the link between the two .
6924,3,When a particular right-hand side literal can not be evaluated deterministically _comma_ the results of its evaluation must uniquely determine the remainder of the right-hand side of the rule in which it appears .
6925,4,Examples  and could be expanded out at the NP level _comma_ but not at the S level .
6926,2,This seems to go against the `` folklore '' of the tagging community _comma_ where smaller tagsets are often held to be better for obtaining good accuracy .
6927,3,Thus our application of the similarity model averages together standard back-off estimates for a set of similar conditioning words .
6928,4,The reason is that this construction typically yields an enormous amount of rules that are ` useless ' .
6929,3,Let  be a given 3-Partition instance .
6930,3,For words not found in the lexicon _comma_ all open-class tags are hypothesised _comma_ with equal probabilities .
6931,3,What seems to be true in practice is that some case slots are in fact dependent but overwhelming majority of them are independent _comma_ due partly to the fact that usually only a few case slots are obligatory and most others are optional .
6932,4,Several sources of information in speech might help infants solve this problem _comma_ including prosody _comma_ semantic correlations and phonotactics .
6933,2,The problem in general _comma_ and for CCG in particular _comma_ is that the implementation language does not have sufficient expressive power to allow a more direct encoding .
6934,3,It also suggests that semantics and isolated words need not play as central a role as one might think ( e.g._comma_ Jusczyk 1993 downplayed the utility of words in isolation ) .
6935,3,This in turn makes it relatively easy to provide proofs of soundness and completeness for an incremental parsing algorithm .
6936,3,P is a total function from  to the set of partial functions from U to U _comma_ and
6937,3,We proposed to use dependency forests to represent case frame patterns .
6938,3,For comparison _comma_ a variety of other data has been collected .
6939,3,For the relations categorized into RightNucleus _comma_ the right node is more important _comma_ from the point of view of abstract generation _comma_ than the left node .
6940,5,This necessitates a dynamic processing strategy _comma_ i.e. _comma_ memoization _comma_ extended with an abstraction function like _comma_ e.g. _comma_ restriction Shieber 1985 _comma_ to weaken filtering and a subsumption check to discard redundant results .
6941,3,To collaborate _comma_ the agents use judgment _comma_ suggestion _comma_ and elaboration moves to refashion an inadequate referring expression .
6942,3,If he follows the shorter branch first _comma_ the duration of the load will be shorter .
6943,4,It is well known that a simple tabulation of frequencies of certain words participating in certain configurations _comma_ for example of frequencies of pairs of a transitive main verb and the head noun of its direct object _comma_ cannot be reliably used for comparing the likelihoods of different alternative configurations .
6944,6,Through reordering the right-hand sides of the rules in the grammar the amount of nondeterminism can be drastically reduced as shown in Minnen et al. 1996 .
6945,5,In the past research _comma_ the distributional pattern of each case slot is learned independently _comma_ and methods of resolving ambiguity are also based on the assumption that case slots are independent Hindle and Rooth 1991 _comma_ Chang et al. 1992 _comma_ Sekine et al. 1992 _comma_ Resnik 1992 _comma_ Grishman and Sterling 1994 _comma_ Alshawi and Carter 1995 _comma_ Li and Abe 1995 _comma_ or dependencies between at most two case slots are considered Brill and Resnik 1994 _comma_ Ratnaparkhi et al. 1994 _comma_ Collins and Brooks 1995 .
6946,3,This process selects the structure candidate with the lowest penalty score _comma_ a value determined based on preference rules on every two neighboring relations in the candidate .
6947,4,If the semantic representation is to be read off syntactic structure _comma_ then the parser must provide a single syntax tree ( possibly with empty nodes ) .
6948,3,In effect _comma_ this hard-wires prohibitions against constant-compound and constant-constant clashes into the semantics of .
6949,3,The latter could then be used by a modified version of the current system as the basis for efficient lookup of spelling patterns which _comma_ as in the current system _comma_ would allow possible lexical roots to be calculated .
6950,6,Our techniques apply to the feature structures described by Carpenter 1992 .
6951,5,This has turned out to be possible -- speedups compared to using the original grammar of in median 60 times were achieved at a cost in coverage of about ten percent Samuelsson 1994a .
6952,3,Suppose _comma_ for example _comma_ we thought that the VP ` ate a peach ' should be interpreted as :
6953,3,For confirmation _comma_ the list of French unknown words was given to a French grammarian _comma_ who predicted that it would be possible to make a good guess at the correct tag from the morphology for around 70 % of the words _comma_ and could narrow down the possible tags to two or three for about a further 25 % .
6954,4,Given the above lexical entries _comma_ it is possible to assign a correctly interrelated c-structure and f-structure to the sentence A girl walks .
6955,3,Results are given in Table  .
6956,3,The set of selected clauses is called the chart .
6957,4,Analyzing compound nouns is one of the crucial issues for natural language processing systems _comma_ in particular for those systems that aim at a wide coverage of domains .
6958,5,This ordering reflects the relative defeasibility of different assumptions .
6959,3,Now we turn to the problem of how to select the best dendroid distribution from among all possible ones to approximate a target joint distribution based on input data ` generated ' by it .
6960,3,The paper demonstrates that research in this area will have to rely on empirical data until complexity theory is developed to a point where it is sufficiently fine-grained and accurate to predict how the properties of individual unification-based grammars will interact with particular parsing algorithms to determine practical performance .
6961,6,As the COMPASS project makes ample use of Xerox technology for its core look-up engine and for POS disambiguation for languages other than German _comma_ the obvious thing to do was to develop a German language model for the Xerox tagger .
6962,5,which serve as an interface to the value of the sem feature _comma_ the actual semantic representation .
6963,3,is given a specific probability value by a word-based model .
6964,3,In addition to the common practice of mapping POS tags according to the words ' suffixes _comma_ this implementation makes use of the case of the initial letter of a word -- which is highly significant for POS assignment in German .
6965,3,Since 1 is a unit element of F _comma_  .
6966,5,If X is an NP node and if the path p to X did not pass through the  node that X immediately dominates _comma_ propose X as the antecedent .
6967,3,We will call this system Partially Linear PATR ( PLPATR ) .
6968,5,where  is the frequency of in the training corpus and N is the total number of bigrams .
6969,5,For example _comma_ the effect of processing the rabbit in the noun phrase the rabbit in the hat is to provide a set of all rabbits .
6970,3,Training texts are pretokenized using an external tokenizer written in lex .
6971,4,Since the types are identical _comma_ coordination can then take place .
6972,3,In this research _comma_ we assume that case frame instances with the same head are generated by a joint distribution of type _comma_
6973,7,In section  the results obtained using the new model are compared with the results from previous models .
6974,3,During plan inference _comma_ the salience hierarchy is used when evaluating a recognized plan .
6975,5,For instance _comma_ the speed of convergence of the models selected by MDL to the true model is known to be near optimal .
6976,3,Tagging accuracy on unknown words using the cascading guesser was detected at 90 - 92 % when tagging with the full-fledged lexicon and 86 - 88 % when tagging with the closed-class and short word lexicon .
6977,3,The basic idea is as follows .
6978,3,This algorithm computes uniformly pragmatic inferences that are associated with simple and complex utterances and sequences of utterances _comma_ and allows cancellations of pragmatic inferences to occur at any time in the discourse .
6979,5,Most existing constraint-based parsing algorithms will terminate for grammars that exhibit the property that for each string there is only a finite number of possible derivations .
6980,2,We find that the constraints of complex sentences are actually local ones .
6981,2,This would be a mistake for many applications _comma_ such as query expansion in information retrieval _comma_ where a surfeit of false connections can outweigh the benefits obtained by using lexical knowledge .
6982,5,The complexity of this algorithm is O(n!) because all permutations ( n! for an input of size n ) may have to be explored to find the correct answer _comma_ and indeed must be explored in order to verify that there is no answer .
6983,3,Recall that a second meaning constructor and 2 is introduced by and in order to handle cases where there are more than two conjuncts ; this contribution will be used once in the derivation of the meaning for sentence  .
6984,3,Then _comma_ after the meta-level  - reduction using the new scoped constant c _comma_ the following goal is called :
6985,3,In this case _comma_ the resolution of the anaphora is postponed to a next call of the anaphora module according to principle  stated above .
6986,5,Magic evaluation constitutes an interesting combination of the advantages of top-down and bottom-up evaluation .
6987,5,Shieber et al. 1990 show that a top-down evaluation strategy will fail for rules such as VP VP X _comma_ irrespective of the order of evaluation of the right-hand side categories in the rule .
6988,4,Evidence from different knowledge sources can be combined in an attempt to optimize the selection of correct hypotheses Alshawi and Carter 1994 _comma_ Rayner et al. 1994 _comma_ Rosenfeld 1994 .
6989,3,Languages with a rich morphology may be more difficult than English since with fewer tokens per type _comma_ there is less data on which to base a categorization decision .
6990,3,This may have to do with how the categories are chosen and defined .
6991,1,We augment typed lambda calculus with several new combinators _comma_ to make the order of  - conversions free for partial / local processing .
6992,3,Since it relies on the notion of a syntactic head instead of a semantic head it works also for grammars where semantic heads are not available in general _comma_ like for a grammar which includes semantic decomposition rules of ( scopally ) Underspecified Discourse Representation Structures .
6993,3,The maximal coverage of S by C is Cov. Ps is the set of parses of S by C with coverage Cov .
6994,3,However _comma_ if we are to base a parser on the rules given above _comma_ it would seem that we gain further .
6995,2,However _comma_ parsing algorithms assume more importance for grammars having more substantial phrase structure components _comma_ such as CLARE ( which although employing some HPSG-like analyses still contains several tens of rules ) and the ANLT ( which uses a formalism derived from GPSG ) Gazdar et al. 1985 _comma_ since the more specific rule set can be used to control which unifications are performed .
6996,3,The second run was conducted with skipping enabled and full heuristics .
6997,3,Although this discussion has argued that it is not possible to thread the states which are used by a dynamic or eliminative semantics from left to right _comma_ word by word _comma_ this should not be taken as an argument against the use of such a semantics in incremental interpretation .
6998,7,In what follows _comma_ we will describe in detail how the description length is to be calculated in our current context _comma_ as well as our simulated annealing algorithm based on MDL .
6999,3,The differing ways in which these types of inference utilize syntactic and semantic representations predicts phenomena for which it is otherwise difficult to account .
7000,4,In fact _comma_ it appears that gapping is felicitous in those constructions where VP-ellipsis requires a syntactic antecedent _comma_ whereas gapping is infelicitous in cases where VP-ellipsis requires only a suitable semantic antecedent .
7001,3,One responds to a question because this is a social behavior that is strongly encouraged as one grows up _comma_ and becomes instilled in the agent .
7002,7,We will now show how the algorithm works by an illustrative example .
7003,3,Similarly _comma_ the generalization that prepositions and transitive verbs are very similar if not identical in the way they govern noun phrases would be lost if `` left '' and `` right '' properties of words were lumped together in one representation .
7004,4,Much of their popularity stems from the way in which syntactic generalization may be elegantly stated by means of constraints amongst features and their values .
7005,3,The formalism should be fine-grained _comma_ ie. responsive to the behaviour of individual words ( as n-gram models are ) .
7006,5,After processing the proposition John left the set of worlds is refined down to those worlds in which John left .
7007,3,licensed by applications of Gricean Maxims such as scalar implicature inferences Hirschberg 1985 .
7008,3,A similar transition occurs for likes .
7009,5,Although the LFG equations discussed so far were defining equations _comma_ LFG also allows so-called constraining equations ( written  ) .
7010,5,For example _comma_ to get the parse above we need the lexical entries :
7011,3,Having formulated the constraints of Gorrell 's model in terms of the accessibility of a node for tree-lowering _comma_ we can see that the model can be falsified if we can find a case where the relevant disambiguating information comes at a point in processing where the node which is required to be lowered is no longer accessible .
7012,3,While it certainly seems to be the case that LFG ( and other ` declarative ' formalisms ) have procedural residues _comma_ it is far from clear that these residues are necessary .
7013,5,discounting the estimates of previously observed events to leave out some positive probability mass for unseen events _comma_ and
7014,3,For instance _comma_ in sentence  above 5 words have 2 alternative tags _comma_ which will generate possible strings before the hypertags are inserted .
7015,3,A noun partition is any set  satisfying _comma_ and .
7016,6,In order to see what could be gained for a German language model by such a hybrid technology _comma_ I used extensions to the Xerox tagger developed at the University of Stuttgart that facilitate initialization of an HMM with values obtained from a pre-tagged corpus Schmid and Kempe 1995 .
7017,3,Even when cycles are removed from the magic part of a compiled grammar and indexing is used to avoid spurious ambiguities as discussed in the previous section _comma_ subsumption checking can not always be eliminated .
7018,3,is rational iff for each and each _comma_ [ [ if is defined then for some _comma_ .
7019,1,In this paper _comma_ we present a robust parser with a recovery mechanism .
7020,3,It is this latter capability which distinguishes ignore rules from regular rules _comma_ as they are functionally equivalent otherwise _comma_ mainly serving as a notational aid for the grammar writer .
7021,6,We start by using features similar to those first investigated by Biber _comma_ but we concentrate on those that are easy to compute assuming we have a part of speech tagger Cutting et al. 1992 _comma_ Church 1988 _comma_ such as such as third person pronoun occurrence rate as opposed to 'general hedges ' Biber 1989 .
7022,3,The crucial point is the provision of some way of storing the extracted part of the interpretation and making it available when required .
7023,1,The paper has presented a method for providing interpretations word by word for basic Categorial Grammar .
7024,3,Deterministic annealing is used to find lowest distortion sets of clusters .
7025,3,In the interest of space _comma_ again we only show a few steps of the derivation .
7026,2,Developed before the era of NL generation _comma_ the system EXPOUND of Chester 1976 can be characterized as an example of direct translation : Although a sophisticated linearization is applied on the input ND proofs _comma_ the steps are then translated locally in a template driven way .
7027,3,Other criteria that should be studied are second and higher order statistics on the respective parameters .
7028,3,In these categories _comma_ there exist observers who are not the experiencer of P _comma_ and observe that experience .
7029,1,We claim that the design of effective strategies must take cognitive factors into account _comma_ propose a new method for testing the hypothesized factors _comma_ and present experimental results on an effective strategy for supporting deliberation .
7030,3,In our current problem _comma_ a simple model means a model with less dependencies _comma_ and thus MDL provides a theoretically sound way to learn only those dependencies that are statistically significant in the given data .
7031,4,The other is a paradigmatic relation : how the words are associated with each other .
7032,2,However none of these methods has considered the way of dealing both phenomena in the same concrete system .
7033,3,I suggested that this assumption can be replaced by adopting a model in which agents ' behavior provides evidence for whether or not mutual understanding has been achieved .
7034,3,There is a record in  that it bit agent _comma_ so that the comparison should be made between and .
7035,4,An attractive feature of the technique is that the algorithm itself is independent of the ( natural ) language to which it is applied .
7036,3,We generalize the principles of INFORMATION QUALITY and PLAN QUALITY _comma_ which predict when an interrupt should occur .
7037,3,Although this is admittedly a rather artificial example _comma_ it remains true that there is no principled upper limit on the number of downsteps that can occur in an utterance Clements 1979 _comma_ 540 _comma_ and so the asymptotic behaviour of F scaling still needs to be addressed .
7038,7,This assumption will also be examined in section  .
7039,3,The analysis of this is an abstraction over kinds of individuals who ate it .
7040,3,Hence _comma_ this parser is suitable for systems in real application areas .
7041,5,The head-corner generator in van Noord 1993 is an illustrative instance of a sophisticated combination of top-down prediction and bottom-up structure building _comma_ see Fig. .
7042,3,A grammar for the target language is then applied to the target form _comma_ generating a syntax tree whose fringe is passed to a speech synthesizer .
7043,4,An important factor in the interpretation of temporal expressions is the classification of situations into different aspectual classes ( or Aktionsarten ) _comma_ which is based on distributional and semantic properties .
7044,3,State-Application can apply _comma_ as in Figure  .
7045,3,As a consequence _comma_ the storage technique used effectively for LIG recognition may be generalized to the case of PLPATR .
7046,5,The list of arguments to the left are gathered under the feature _comma_ l _comma_ and those to the right _comma_ an np and a pp in that order _comma_ under the feature r .
7047,3,So _comma_ we performed an independent evaluation of the impact of the word guessers on tagging accuracy .
7048,5,One approach to this problem is to refine parsing algorithms by developing techniques such as restrictions _comma_ structure-sharing _comma_ and lazy unification that reduce the amount of structure that is stored and hence the need for copying of features structures Shieber 1985 _comma_ Pereira 1985 _comma_ Karttunen and Kay 1985 _comma_ Wroblewski 1987 _comma_ Gerdemann 1989 _comma_ Godden 1990 _comma_ Kogure 1990 _comma_ Emele 1991 _comma_ Tomabechi 1991 _comma_ Harrison and Ellison 1992 .
7049,3,However _comma_ although the technique still seems far from practical application to NLP tasks _comma_ it may be most useful for providing experimental insight to lexicographers .
7050,5,It interacts with another module called the semantics processor _comma_ which computes representations of intrasentential anaphoric relations _comma_ ( among other things ) .
7051,3,For example _comma_ in the abstract generation mentioned above _comma_ sentence two does not appear solely in the abstract _comma_ but appears always with sentence one .
7052,3,To do this _comma_ unbounded feature information is passed up the tree in a way that violates the constraints developed in this paper .
7053,3,This research was made possible by the basic research programme at the Swedish Institute of Computer Science ( SICS ) .
7054,3,An utterance hypothesis encountered at run time is then treated as if it had been selected from the subpopulation of sentences represented by one of these subcorpora .
7055,3,Given that the transition is a shift _comma_ there seem to be more and less coherent ways to shift .
7056,2,We see several advantages of this approach over that of Lascarides and Asher _comma_ henceforth L and A .
7057,2,This turns out to be quite a bit more precise than the common technique of measuring distances by judging etymon identity _comma_ and requires even less editorial work .
7058,7,We seek to account for these facts in the sections that follow .
7059,3,It was not found necessary to use number information at this stage .
7060,3,Definition 3 .
7061,3,Context free rules are typically used for this purpose -- which means _comma_ in effect _comma_ that constraints are being imposed on the ` daughter of ' and ` sister of ' relations of the tree .
7062,3,For both of these equations we are forced to have h = l which does not seem to be empirically justifiable in view of the data in Figure  .
7063,3,If the argument of cat is a tree _comma_ cat returns the category of the rightmost leaf of the tree .
7064,2,it does not consist of an infinite list of statements .
7065,5,In their fundamental experiment _comma_ Clark and Wilkes-Gibbs 1986 demonstrated that conversants use a set of inherently collaborative procedures to establish the mutual belief that the hearer has understood a reference .
7066,6,We therefore revise the earlier framework to model what we will term occurrences of f-structures as resources explicitly in the logic .
7067,3,And there is no reason why the items characterizing the sentence have to be ( sequences of ) words ; occurrences of grammar rules _comma_ either without any context or in the context of _comma_ say _comma_ the rules occurring just above them in the parse tree _comma_ can be treated in just the same way .
7068,5,From node X _comma_ go up the tree to the first NP or S node encountered .
7069,3,This means that even if the induced criteria produce grammars that are a factor two or three slower than this _comma_ they are still approximately one and a half order of magnitude faster than the original setup .
7070,6,The work reported here follows this treatment _comma_ but extends it by introducing quantifier-like entities for dealing with presuppositional items such as definite NPs ( see Ramsay 1992b _comma_ Ramsay 1994a for a formal account of such CONSTRAINTS on whether a sentence is meaningful with respect to a situation ) .
7071,3,detects conflicts in beliefs and initiates a negotiation subdialogue only when the conflict is relevant to the current task _comma_
7072,6,The technical vehicle previously used to extract the specialized grammar is explanation-based generalization ( EBG ) Mitchell et al. 1986 .
7073,4,The case for probability theory is strengthened by a well developed empirical methodology in the form of statistical parameter estimation .
7074,4,The problem of data sparseness arises when analyses contain configurations that never occurred in the training corpus .
7075,3,The rhetorical structure represents logical relations between sentences or blocks of sentences of each section of the document .
7076,3,If an `` incorrect '' parse occurs we can then check whether that sentence was properly marked up .
7077,3,A split of evaluation efforts into quantitative versus qualitative is incoherent .
7078,1,In this paper we are concerned with the syntactic analysis phase of a natural language understanding system .
7079,3,We also believe that there are other levels of structure in discourse that are not captured by the control rules _comma_ e.g. control shifts do not always correspond with task boundaries .
7080,1,We propose a paradigm for concurrent natural language generation .
7081,5,In addressing this example _comma_ Lascarides and Asher specify a special rule ( the Connections When Changing Tense ( CCT ) Law ) that stipulates that a sentence containing the simple past followed by a sentence containing the past perfect can be related only by a subset of the otherwise possible coherence relations .
7082,6,The built-in  - term manipulation is used as a `` meta-language '' in which the `` object-language '' of CCG logical forms is expressed _comma_ and variables in the object-language are mapped to variables in the meta-language .
7083,3,With reference to English and Japanese processing data _comma_ we show the importance of this search for empirical adequacy of the psycholinguistic model .
7084,4,Therefore the subject of the VP with te _comma_ which is possibly omitted from surface _comma_ should corefer with the subject of the sentence .
7085,3,Similarly _comma_ we can project text and episodes _comma_ and recall the most relevant episode for interpretation of the text .
7086,5,Such an implementation is described in earlier work of the author Feldweg 1993 _comma_ Feldweg 1995a .
7087,2,Mercer 1987 formalizes presuppositions in a logical framework that handles defaults Reiter 1980 _comma_ but this approach is not tractable and it treats natural disjunction as an exclusive-or and implication as logical equivalence .
7088,3,In this case _comma_ it will have a category .
7089,3,The effect of the distinction between partial and total downstep is to allow different transcriptions of the same string _comma_ as we saw in  .
7090,2,However _comma_ if coordination of the first two conjuncts occurs at this level _comma_ it is difficult to see how to deal with the final conjunct .
7091,4,The difficulties in morphological analysis and error detection in Semitic arise from the following facts :
7092,3,This information has partly to be specified in the input ( e.g. _comma_ the number for a noun ) and is partly inherited from other elements ( e.g. _comma_ the number for a verb or the case for a noun ) .
7093,3,Performance is consistently better than for the evaluation on all contexts _comma_ indicating that the low quality of the distributional information about punctuation marks and rare words is a difficulty for successful tag induction .
7094,3,However _comma_ we present the results of our algorithm in three medium-sized domains .
7095,3,I also discussed some of the effects of resource bounds _comma_ ie. cases of ensuring that or providing evidence that certain inferences dependent on what is said are made .
7096,3,Intuitively _comma_  means that the constraint holds at ( is true at _comma_ is satisfied at ) the node n in model .
7097,3,However _comma_ clusters do not improve trigram modeling at all .
7098,1,In this paper we focus on interactive discourse .
7099,3,When  takes on 1 or 0 as its value _comma_ we call the model a ` slot-based model '.
7100,4,A consonantal segment may be omitted from the phonetic surface form _comma_ but maintained in the orthographic surface from .
7101,3,Control shifts occur because it is unusual for a single participant to be responsible for coordinating the achievement of the whole discourse plan .
7102,5,There have been some attempts to capture the behavior of semantic categories in a distributional setting _comma_ despite the unavailability of sense-annotated corpora .
7103,3,These are displayed by lhip_ms_success :
7104,5,Variants of the composition rule were proposed in order to deal with non-peripheral extraction _comma_ but this led to unwanted effects elsewhere in the grammar Bouma 1987 .
7105,5,In n-gram models and the Inside-Outside algorithm _comma_ this issue is evaded by bounding the size and form of the grammars considered _comma_ so that the `` optimal '' grammar cannot be expressed .
7106,4,We focus here on a particular kind of configuration _comma_ word cooccurrence .
7107,3,induction based on word type and context _comma_ restricted to `` natural '' contexts
7108,3,We can represent the left vectors of all words in the corpus as a matrix C with n rows _comma_ one for each word whose left neighbors are to be represented _comma_ and k columns _comma_ one for each of the possible neighbors .
7109,3,Long hesitations should be avoided during the production of an utterance _comma_ in order to be acceptable to the hearer .
7110,3,This way we provide an elegant solution to the problems with empty heads and efficient bidirectional processing which is illustrated for the special case of HPSG generation .
7111,3,These transitions would capture the likelihood of a word having a particular part of speech _comma_ and the probability of a particular transition being performed with that part of speech .
7112,5,Design-World is an experimental environment for testing the relationship between discourse strategies _comma_ task parameters and agents ' cognitive capabilities _comma_ similar to the single agent TileWorld simulation environment Pollack and Ringuette 1990 _comma_ Hanks et al. 1993 .
7113,4,Constituent and non-constituent coordination have been treated as entirely separate phenomena ( see van Oirsouw 1987 for discussion ) _comma_ and different mechanisms have been proposed for each .
7114,4,Most editors allow the user to enter such diacritics above and below letters .
7115,7,In this section we describe the LHIP system .
7116,5,Visual feedback could be used to provide confirmation ( for example _comma_ by highlighting an object referred to by a successful definite description ) _comma_ or it could be used to give the user an improved chance of achieving successful reference .
7117,5,Equation  modifies slightly Katz 's presentation to include the placeholder for alternative models of the distribution of unseen bigrams .
7118,6,A small principle-based parser was built _comma_ following the proper branch formalism developed in Crocker and Lewin 1992 .
7119,3,Theorem 24 .
7120,5,For any input _comma_ including grammatical and extragrammatical sentences _comma_ this algorithm can generate the resultant parse tree .
7121,3,There are two significant difficulties with collecting test data .
7122,3,If  is rational then for each resolved feature structure R _comma_ R is satisfiable .
7123,3,In future work we will address other forms of ellipsis and event reference _comma_ as well as integrate a previous account of strict and sloppy ambiguity into this framework Kehler 1993a .
7124,5,Results suggest that parents exaggerate prosody in child-directed speech to highlight important words Fernald and Mazzie 1991 _comma_ Aslin et al. in press and that infants are sensitive to prosody Hirsh-Pasek et al. 1987 .
7125,3,This distribution indicates that some control segments are hierarchically related to others .
7126,3,We now have a complete table for R :
7127,6,We earlier described two taggers for French : the statistical one having an accuracy of 95 - 97 % and the constraint-based one 97 - 99 % Chanod and Tapanainen 1994 _comma_ Chanod and Tapanainen 1995 .
7128,2,However _comma_ his experiment was not based on the errors in running texts but on artificial ones which were randomly generated by human .
7129,5,Suzuki 's algorithm first calculates the mutual information between all two nodes ( random variables ) _comma_ and it sorts the node pairs in descending order with respect to the mutual information .
7130,4,In contrast _comma_ a model with more clusters _comma_ such as Model 1 in Figure  _comma_ is more complex _comma_ but tends to have a better fit to the data .
7131,5,The bilingual dual-coding theory proposes an architecture in which a common imagery system is connected to two verbal systems _comma_ and the two verbal systems are interconnected to each other via associative connections [ Figure  ] .
7132,4,Nevertheless _comma_ probability theory does offer a coherent and relatively well understood framework for selecting between uncertain alternatives _comma_ making it a natural choice for quantitative language processing .
7133,1,We present a methodology to extract Selectional Restrictions at a variable level of abstraction from phrasally analyzed corpora .
7134,1,In this work we propose a method for estimating the probability of such previously unseen word combinations using available information on `` most similar '' words .
7135,5,The node X is the highest S node in  _comma_ so we go to the previous sentence .
7136,1,We present LHIP _comma_ a system for incremental grammar development using an extended DCG formalism .
7137,3,This is because the resolution rules may have an empty role as a parameter _comma_ due to this unattached preposition .
7138,3,Obligations are quite different from and can not be reduced to intentions and goals .
7139,1,This paper introduces a spelling correction system which integrates seamlessly with morphological analysis using a multi-tape formalism .
7140,1,Thus _comma_ provision of an effective method of learning dependencies between case slots _comma_ as well as investigation of the usefulness of the acquired dependencies in disambiguation and other natural language processing tasks would be an important contribution to the field .
7141,1,The extension we propose makes them more specific still .
7142,3,Furthermore _comma_ there is no requirement for mutually-agreed upon rules that create obligations .
7143,2,Experience so far suggests that systems like LHIP may in the right circumstances provide an alternative to these approaches .
7144,3,where  is thickness of the k-th link of _comma_ and is activity ( at time T ) of the node referred by the k-th link of .
7145,3,This finding has consequences for the COMPASS project _comma_ where POS disambiguation is employed as one means of disambiguating word senses to facilitate precise dictionary look-up .
7146,3,which completes the proof .
7147,4,Above examples show that people are used to write same meaningful sentences differently .
7148,1,To explore the phenomenon of control in relation to ATTENTIONAL STATE Grosz and Sidner 1986 _comma_ Grosz et al. 1986 _comma_ Sidner 1979 .
7149,5,The result indicates that slot ` arg 2 ' and ` from ' should be considered dependent on ` to ' .
7150,5,Gunji proposed the more detailed structure _comma_ in which starting from predicate _comma_ say _comma_ verb and adjective _comma_ objects _comma_ voice _comma_ subject _comma_ aspect _comma_ tense _comma_ modality _comma_ topic and mood are or might be sequentially added to make an informationally more fulfilled sentence component .
7151,5,Such models have also been explored computationally Milward 1995 _comma_ Crocker 1991 .
7152,3,There is no single best answer : it depends on one 's goals .
7153,5,Naming objects and imaging to words are prototypical examples .
7154,3,The second role can be captured by the parser constructing semantic representations directly .
7155,3,Now the problem is how to approximate a joint distribution by the product of lower order component distributions .
7156,3,We record the contribution each cluster  makes to as
7157,5,The second conjunct is then parsed according to this configuration .
7158,4,For instance _comma_ no special category assignments need to be stipulated to handle a relative clause containing a trace _comma_ because it is analyzed _comma_ via hypothetical reasoning _comma_ like a traceless clause with the trace being the hypothesis to be discharged when combined with the relative pronoun .
7159,3,We also assume that the category of the right branch of a ( sub ) tree represents the category of the ( sub ) tree itself .
7160,3,The regression equations obtained from these data are displayed in  _comma_ where the number of occurrences of each tone sequence is given in parentheses after the sequence .
7161,3,Finally _comma_ the PP attachment procedure has to be called again for the in and on PPs .
7162,5,Traditionally _comma_ disambiguation problems in parsing have been addressed by enumerating possibilities and explicitly declaring knowledge which might aid the disambiguation process .
7163,5,Mikami categorized clauses into three classes _comma_ namely ` open ' _comma_ ` semi-open ' and ` closed ' .
7164,2,Given the widespread part-of-speech ambiguity of words this is problematic .
7165,4,In  the property of being a man combines with the property of being someone who stole your bike to construct a contextually minimal unique characterisation of the relevant individual _comma_ and similarly in .
7166,3,In most cases _comma_ errors should be recovered by appropriate self-corrections .
7167,5,Since natural languages put together verbs and prepositions in a sentence _comma_ we have developped a formal calculus Asher and Sablayrolles 1994b _comma_ based on these two typologies _comma_ which computes _comma_ in a compositional way _comma_ the spatiotemporal properties of a motion complex from the semantic properties of the verb and of the preposition .
7168,5,some IRU strategies are only beneficial when inferential complexity is higher than in the Standard Task Rambow and Walker 1994 _comma_ Walker 1994a .
7169,5,Parameters  are tied together for similar c to prevent data sparsity .
7170,3,Tables  and present results for word type-based induction and induction based on word type and context .
7171,2,This assumption is challenged by a number of cases in naturally occurring dialogues where inferences that follow from what has been said are made explicit .
7172,3,The pair coordinates come from two large sets  and _comma_ with no preexisting topological or metric structure _comma_ and the training data is a sequence S of N independently drawn pairs .
7173,3,The algorithm used for calculating the temporal structure of a discourse can be summarised as follows .
7174,3,If the counts of neighbors are assembled into a vector ( with one dimension for each neighbor ) _comma_ the cosine can be employed to measure similarity .
7175,3,This difference is again supported by word type data : 14 % recall with 30 % accuracy for adult-directed speech _comma_ 56 % recall with 65 % accuracy for child-directed speech .
7176,3,We begin by describing the fundamentals of a greedy incremental generation algorithm .
7177,1,We have presented a polynomial complexity generation algorithm which can form part of any Shake-and-Bake style MT system with suitable grammars and information transfer .
7178,3,And sometimes this ambiguity is unwarranted .
7179,3,The linguistic studies _comma_ used for the typologies of CoL verbs and spatial prepositions _comma_ have been realized on verbs considered without any adjuncts _comma_ in their atemporal form and independently of any context _comma_ on the one hand _comma_ and on prepositions considered independently of any context _comma_ on the other .
7180,3,Although much work remains to be done _comma_ there is reason to believe that these results are domain independent .
7181,3,Thus this correctly predicts the unacceptability of the following :
7182,3,Then we would like a formula which predicts  given _comma_ and ( i > 1 ) .
7183,3,The performance of DIST-PHONO on child-directed speech shows that this system goes a long way toward solving the segmentation problem .
7184,2,This is not captured by the Lascarides and Asher account because sentences containing the past perfect are treated as sententially equivalent to those containing the simple past .
7185,3,Secondly _comma_ it makes only modest additional demands on training data .
7186,1,In this paper we investigate how we can generalize this approach for unification grammars .
7187,3,All of the accuracy figures quoted below are for ambiguous words only .
7188,4,We observe then that in some sense the adjectives stark _comma_ grand and heavy are equivalent in the collocational context _comma_ but that this is of course not typically the case in other contexts _comma_ cf grande boite _comma_ starke Schachtel and heavy box _comma_ where the adjectives could hardly be viewed as equivalent .
7189,3,The results above show that if it were not for unknown words _comma_ there might be some argument for favouring larger tagsets _comma_ since they have some tendency to give a higher accuracy .
7190,3,The second membrane  requires an agent role ( the variable x ' of make ) .
7191,3,Partial syntax trees can be regarded as performing two main roles .
7192,5,In fact _comma_ Troll represents each feature structure as a disjunction of the resolvants of the feature structure .
7193,3,is computable iff [ _comma_ and are countable _comma_
7194,4,The meaning of each word in a text depends on the structure of the text .
7195,3,Two human judges were independently given the test cases to disambiguate .
7196,4,For example _comma_ a clustered bigram model will probably not be as powerful as a trigram model .
7197,5,Top-down hierarchical planning views language generation as planned behavior .
7198,3,However _comma_ as the  operator is quite a convenient piece of syntax for capturing the effect of phrase structure rules _comma_ we have included it as a primitive in .
7199,5,The result was a poor performance of the resulting HMM with an error rate of  .
7200,2,Hence _comma_ the head-corner generator of Fig.  with a link relation based on semantic heads will not be applicable .
7201,5,The Temporal Centering framework Kameyama et al. 1993 integrates aspects of both approaches _comma_ but patterns with the first in treating tense as anaphoric .
7202,4,The possible sources of SRs are : introspection by lexicographers _comma_ machine-readable dictionaries _comma_ and on-line corpora .
7203,3,is activity of the most plausible subrfrant in _comma_ defined as follows :
7204,5,An important aspect of this tagger is that it will give good accuracy with a minimal amount of manually tagged training data .
7205,3,These recognition hypotheses are passed to a parser which applies a logic-based grammar and lexicon to produce a set of logical forms _comma_ specifically formulas in first order logic corresponding to possible interpretations of the utterance .
7206,3,If wh-arguments need to be treated specially anyway ( to deal with non-peripheral extraction ) _comma_ and if composition as a general rule is problematic _comma_ this suggests we should perhaps return to grammars which use just Application as a general operation _comma_ but have a special treatment for wh-arguments .
7207,5,In our earlier work _comma_ we built on Sidner 's proposal / acceptance and proposal / rejection sequences Sidner 1994 and developed a model that captures collaborative planning processes in a Propose-Evaluate-Modify cycle of actions Chu-Carroll and Carberry 1994 .
7208,3,Firstly _comma_ consider conjuncts which correspond one to one in the categories of the corresponding words .
7209,3,The tagger was used to annotate all of the 50 million word German corpora contained on the ECI Multilingual Corpus 1 CD-ROM .
7210,2,However _comma_ in our work we do not wish to limit the size of the grammars considered .
7211,4,During simultaneous interpretation requests are rather unusual .
7212,3,Whenever the scope of the system is extended it has been found necessary to enhance these elements .
7213,3,It should be capable of capturing fully the linguistic intuitions of language users .
7214,3,Using preferences _comma_ we reduce that to 2 readings for each continuation .
7215,3,The only change needed from AACG notation is the inclusion of an extra feature list _comma_ the h list _comma_ which stores information about which arguments are waiting for a head ( the reasons for this will be explained later ) .
7216,3,The rationale for the distinction between sanctioned and unsanctioned non-coverage of input is twofold .
7217,3,The general processing model therefore consists of transitions of the form :
7218,1,In this paper _comma_ we claim that a variety of facts concerning ellipsis resolution _comma_ event reference _comma_ and interclausal coherence can be explained by the interaction between the syntactic and semantic properties of the form in question and the type of discourse inference operative in establishing the coherence of the antecedent and elided clauses .
7219,3,Our results indicate that while there is some useful information in both phoneme distributions and phonotactic rules _comma_ the combination of both sources is most useful .
7220,3,The reconstructed proof is a proof tree _comma_ where proof nodes are derived from their children by applying an inference method ( also called a justification ) .
7221,3,Just finding any set of cutnodes that yields the desired coverage will not necessarily result in a grammar that is well suited for LR parsing .
7222,6,The analysis above was obtained in a framework where quantifier scope is determined on the basis of information explicitly associated with a form of COOPER STORAGE Cooper 1983 _comma_ using abstraction operators of the form _comma_ or which can be applied to a formula to bind its free variables .
7223,3,Here the conjuncts must provide the same transitions _comma_ and hence must be able to coordinate ( this is a reflection of the fact that processing can back up to any point in the parsing history ) .
7224,5,Each proper branch is a binary branching structure _comma_ and so all grammatical constraints will need to be encoded locally .
7225,3,If this expression is applied to a formula containing a free occurrence of X it will return an abstraction with respect to X -- exactly what we want .
7226,3,The proposed method should be improved in two directions .
7227,3,For example _comma_
7228,3,(A2) AMBIGUITY :
7229,3,Each agent has his own beliefs about salience .
7230,3,First _comma_ the rule is read and the RHS clauses are partitioned into those marked as heads _comma_ and those not .
7231,3,There seem to be two reasons why shifts occur in the TODs .
7232,3,Our Earley generator and the described compiler for off-line grammar optimization have been extensively tested with a large HPSG grammar .
7233,3,split the task of the presentation of a proof with ordered subproofs into subtasks .
7234,1,The goal is to find an unsupervised method for tagging that relies on general distributional properties of text _comma_ properties that are invariant across languages and sublanguages .
7235,3,Measurements were taken from the following data .
7236,3,There is a need to incorporate some kind of generalized notion of linearity into such a system .
7237,3,VM-GEN is able to consume input increments of varying size .
7238,3,In this sense _comma_ the constraints in the main clause can be treated as almost local constraints of the main clause .
7239,7,This section discusses the nature of the structure and states of Paradigme _comma_ and also the nature of the similarity computed on it .
7240,3,Suppose for example that in the analysis of the sentence
7241,1,We presented and tested a number of hypotheses about the factors that contribute to the decision of when to include a warrant in a proposal .
7242,3,For each  _comma_ is a semi-morph .
7243,5,Brill 1995 outlines a transformation-based learner which learns guessing rules from a pre-tagged training corpus .
7244,3,Finally _comma_ the model 's error types are described .
7245,3,A colon `` : '' separates multiple categories assigned to a word .
7246,3,Thus mutual beliefs depend on a defeasible inference process .
7247,3,is a nonempty subset of _comma_
7248,3,The system first extracts the rhetorical structure _comma_ the compound of the rhetorical relations between sentences _comma_ and then cuts out less important parts in the extracted structure to generate an abstract of the desired length .
7249,3,We thus see how the TNCBs can mirror the dominance information in the source language parse in order to furnish the generator with a good initial guess .
7250,3,However _comma_ the equivalent of this kind of minimal types in untyped feature structure grammars are constants which can be used in a similar fashion for off-line optimization .
7251,3,Experimental results demonstrate that using the dependency information _comma_ when dependency does exist _comma_ structural disambiguation results can be improved .
7252,3,We will apply default handling to microplanning and lexical choice within VERBMOBIL .
7253,3,there is an empirical way to determine an optimum collection of rules _comma_ since acquired rules are subject to rigorous direct evaluation in terms of precision _comma_ recall and coverage ;
7254,6,The algorithm is part of an HPSG-style discourse grammar implemented in Carpenter 's ALE formalism .
7255,3,We illustrate this analysis by constructing a DRS in Figure  b for sentence .
7256,3,Index the treebank in an and-or tree where the or-nodes correspond to alternative choices of grammar rules to expand with and the and-nodes correspond to the RHS phrases of each grammar rule .
7257,5,This makes semantic interpretation a highly order-dependent affair ; e.g. the order in which a functor is composed with its arguments can substantially affect the resulting meaning .
7258,3,To which extent it is useful to collapse magic predicates using unfolding depends on whether the grammar has been optimized through reordering the right-hand sides of the rules in the grammar as discussed in section  .
7259,3,We have provided an illustration on how to proceed in one such case .
7260,3,It seems likely that what is going on is that the model is converging to towards something of similar `` quality '' in each case _comma_ but when the pattern is classical _comma_ the convergence starts from a lower quality model and improves _comma_ and in the other cases _comma_ it starts from a higher quality one and deteriorates .
7261,5,DCGs are represented using the same notation we used for context-free grammars _comma_ but now of course the category symbols can be first-order terms of arbitrary complexity ( note that without loss of generality we don't take into account DCGs having external actions defined in curly braces ) .
7262,7,In this section we present some applications of our analysis to related constructions .
7263,3,In the finite-state grammar each word is associated with a transition between two categories _comma_ in the tree above ` a ' with the transition A  B and so on .
7264,2,Such conundrums led Paris and others to conclude that the dialect boundary _comma_ and therefore the very notion of dialect _comma_ is an ill-defined concept .
7265,3,The results suggest that a completely unconstrained initial model does not produce good quality results _comma_ and that one accurately trained from a hand-tagged corpus will generally do better than using an approach based on re-estimation _comma_ even when the training comes from a different source .
7266,3,Penalty scores are imposed on the structure candidates violating the preference rules .
7267,5,Head-driven generation methods combine both _comma_ top-down search and bottom-up combination _comma_ in an ideal way .
7268,3,Charts such as Table  provide the observations we use to fill in the value of RHET_RELN .
7269,3,An annotated corpus comprising some of the various NL input types such as those I discussed in the introduction would go a long way towards giving us a basis against which we could evaluate the generality of our theories .
7270,3,This means that it is difficult for the speaker to verify when an action has achieved its expected result _comma_ and so giving and receiving evidence is critical and the process of establishing mutual beliefs is carefully monitored by the conversants .
7271,5,Finch and Chater 1992 and Finch 1993 use vector models in which words are clustered according to the similarity of their close neighbors in a corpus .
7272,3,Figure  shows the representations for the clause Hillary did ( the anaphoric expression is indicated by P ) .
7273,3,The formalism as currently described can be used to simulate arbitrary Turing Machine computations .
7274,3,The formalism _comma_ which we refer to as Partially Linear PATR ( PLPATR ) manipulates feature structures rather than stacks .
7275,3,From a million words of parsed Wall Street Journal data from the Penn treebank _comma_ we extracted the 20 most frequently occurring symbols _comma_ and the 10 most frequently occurring rules expanding each of these symbols .
7276,3,See Figure  .
7277,3,Here the ambiguity rate is 1.52 .
7278,3,All rules and lexical entries in the CLE are compiled to a form that allows normal Prolog unification to be used for category matching at run time .
7279,5,We can see easily that MDL generalizes MLE _comma_ in that it also takes into account the complexity of the model itself .
7280,4,When the situation requires the negotiation of a collaborative plan _comma_ these theories must account for the interacting beliefs and intentions of multiple participants .
7281,1,In this paper we will describe some substantial modifications to the basic technique and will report the corresponding experimental evaluation .
7282,3,The assumption _comma_ rather than being a hypothesis or a default _comma_ get upgraded to a support type of linguistic as a result of the IRU .
7283,3,Finally _comma_ It would be interesting to investigate the solution to point f. One possible way would be to disambiguate the senses of the verbs appearing in the corpus _comma_ using the SRs already acquired and gathering evidence of the patterns corresponding to each sense by means of a technique similar to that used by Yarowsky 1992 .
7284,6,In this paper we adopt the latter theoretically more interesting perspective .
7285,3,The tagger used in the experiments took a very simple-minded approach to unknown words .
7286,4,Therefore _comma_ extragrammatical sentences should be handled by some recovery mechanism ( s ) rather than by a set of additional rules .
7287,3,In the preceding sections the evaluation of the model was purely quantitative .
7288,5,Hobbs developed a theory in which he arranged three kinds of relationships between sentences from the text coherency viewpoint Hobbs 1979 .
7289,3,Although there is some variations in the readings _comma_ for example in the `` similar / D0 + T0 '' case _comma_ we can draw some general conclusions about the patterns obtained from different sorts of data .
7290,5,A parsing phase _comma_ which outputs a multiset _comma_ or bag _comma_ of source language signs instantiated with sufficiently rich linguistic information established by the parse to ensure adequate translations .
7291,3,existing n-gram modeling techniques are inadequate for parsing models .
7292,3,So _comma_ not all the generated edges are processed by the robust parser _comma_ but the most plausible parse trees can be generated first .
7293,3,They also take into account the syntactic structure of the sentence ( we have supposed an X-bar syntax with a VP internal subject _comma_ though this is not essential ) and the links which exist at the level of discours between this sentence and the previous and following sentences of the text .
7294,3,Therefore these constraints are local in subordinate clause .
7295,1,The current state of dialectometry thus presents two main questions which constitute the methodological focus of this paper .
7296,5,An analysis of proposals in a corpus of 55 problem-solving dialogues shows that communicating agents don't always include warrants in a proposal _comma_ and suggest a number of hypotheses about which factors affect their decision Walker 1993 _comma_ Pollack et al. 1982 .
7297,5,According to de Swart 1991 Partee 's quantification problem is similar - the universal quantifier in sentences such as binds pairs of events and updated reference times _comma_ where the desired quantificational scheme is universal quantification for the event and existential for the reference time .
7298,3,As a consequence there is a tendency to use the grammar rules to accumulate a single _comma_ large feature structure giving a complete encoding of the analysis .
7299,6,As did Lascarides and Asher 1993 _comma_ we capture this ordering as a constraint imposed by the Narration coherence relation itself :
7300,4,This structure can be represented as follows :
7301,4,Semitic is known amongst computational linguists _comma_ in particular computational morphologists _comma_ for its highly inflexional morphology .
7302,5,The dialogue manager must keep track of the current state of the dialogue _comma_ determine the effects of observed conversation acts _comma_ generate utterances back _comma_ and send commands to the domain plan reasoner and domain plan executor when appropriate .
7303,2,The main innovation is that the algorithm is able to deal with part-of-speech ambiguity _comma_ a pervasive phenomenon in natural language that was unaccounted for in previous work on learning categories from corpora .
7304,5,It then switches roles to become the speaker _comma_ and looks for a goal to adopt _comma_ and constructs a plan that achieves it .
7305,3,These models can be further classified into three types of probabilistic models according to the type of values each random variable  assumes .
7306,1,In this paper _comma_ we describe an experiment on fully automatic derivation of the knowledge necessary for part-of-speech tagging .
7307,7,In section  it will be seen how the use of abstract syntax allows this to be expressed directly .
7308,3,The most general of these is that even quite crude corpus statistics can provide information about the syntax of compound nouns .
7309,2,I argue that Hidden Markov Models are unsuited to the task and I demonstrate the importance of having a computational tool which allows phonologists to experiment with F  scaling parameters .
7310,5,can be instantiated to the set of equations in by setting R as follows :
7311,3,SEM_ASPECT : Contains the semantic aspect ( event _comma_ state _comma_ activity ) .
7312,1,This paper aims at presenting a morphographemic model which can cope with both issues .
7313,5,In the experiment _comma_ two subjects were each given a set of hard-to-describe tangram figures that were kept hidden from the other .
7314,5,Frank and Reyle 1992 proposed rules for the construction of UDRS 's in an HPSG-style syntax _comma_ cf. Pollard and Sag 1993 _comma_ which are shown in Fig. and in a somewhat adapted manner .
7315,3,That is _comma_ if the agent is the initiator _comma_ she believes that the other will be able to understand the reference ; if the agent is the other _comma_ he believes that he has understood the reference .
7316,1,The aim of the quantitative language and translation models presented in sections  and is to employ probabilistic parameters that reflect linguistic structure without discarding rich lexical information or making the models too complex to train automatically .
7317,5,In the latter case another possible application concerns the treatment of phenomena such as repairs Carter 1994 .
7318,5,So if a question is asked _comma_ only a fixed number of activities _comma_ namely those introduced by a question _comma_ are co-operative responses .
7319,5,Another possibility would be Euclidean distance _comma_ with each word in the vocabulary defining a dimension in a vector space .
7320,5,There have been several attempts to treat coordination by adapting pre-existing parsing strategies .
7321,3,In our FS _comma_ constraints for tokens like  are written with `` where '' as shown in this FS .
7322,3,The f-structure for example  is given in .
7323,3,Consider first the uniqueness principle .
7324,3,Further analysis showed that only 2 sentences had parses that were better than those selected by our integrated parse evaluation heuristic .
7325,4,For example _comma_ one could construct vector representations of senses on the basis of their co-occurrence with words or with other senses .
7326,2,since the ` antecedent ' sentence John are alike and Mary are alike is nonsensical ( it is also ungrammatical if we consider number agreement ) .
7327,5,Thus _comma_ a collaborative dialogue is modeled in terms of the evolution of the referring plan .
7328,5,Sag et al. deal with these examples by treating categories as feature bundles _comma_ and allowing coordination in cases where there are features in common .
7329,4,Conversely _comma_ more detail in the tagset may help the tagger when the properties of two adjacent words give support to the choice of tag for both of them ; that is _comma_ the transitions between tags contribute the information the tagger needs .
7330,3,The significance of the use of conceptual association deserves some mention .
7331,3,An informal semantics of the operator can be given by positing a set of rules of behavior R .
7332,3,In particular _comma_ we preserved the notion of hierarchical phrase structure .
7333,3,This highly redundant code will aid the processing of sparse data typical of natural language .
7334,3,The elements of the most frequent ambiguity types for German _comma_ however _comma_ belong to the same major word classes _comma_ with only a few exception such as :
7335,6,The implementation described in this paper is based on the most recent model _comma_ that of Gorrell in press .
7336,3,Second _comma_ we take  to be a tuple of the form _comma_ where W is a finite _comma_ non-empty set of nodes ; is a partial function from W to W _comma_ for all ; initial is a unique node in W such that any other node w ' of W can be reached by applying a finite number of to initial ; Final is a non-empty set of nodes such that for all and all _comma_ is undefined ; and is a function from Final to .
7337,3,Given that  it follows that .
7338,5,It has also been the subject of a number of psycholinguistic studies on a more theoretical level Pritchett 1992 _comma_ Gorrell in press .
7339,3,We would use two measures for cv :  returns the relative frequency of collation _comma_ which appears on the left side and _comma_ which appears on the right .
7340,2,However _comma_ the optimal grammar under this objective function is one which generates only strings in the training data and no other strings .
7341,3,Here the vocalism indicates the inflection ( e.g. broken plural ) and the preferance of vocalism pattern for that type of inflection belongs to the root .
7342,3,Firstly _comma_ LFG grammars impose constraints on  .
7343,3,The Instructor is not in possession of critical information such as the current state of the apprentice 's pump .
7344,3,In passage  _comma_ the auxiliary had refers to the event time of the slipping _comma_ and thus the past tense on spill creates a temporal entity constrained to precede that time .
7345,3,The process is carried out during the transfer stage so information is available from both the Japanese original and the selected English translation .
7346,3,Thanks to all who offered advice on finding data _comma_ and to Dough McIlroy _comma_ Sue Blackwell and Neil Rowe for sending me their misspelling lists .
7347,3,Obviously _comma_ the more clusters are assumed _comma_ the more likely it is that the increase in the number of parameters to be estimated will lead to worsened rather than improved performance .
7348,7,In the next section I shall investigate the phonetic interpretation of tone in Bamileke Dschang _comma_ and determine the values of R for this language .
7349,3,The changes were then applied to the training corpus .
