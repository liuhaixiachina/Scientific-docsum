1863,0,Now _comma_ it is certainly possible to talk about models using natural language ( as readers of this paper will already be aware ) and for many purposes ( such as discussion with other linguists ) natural language is undoubtedly the best medium .
6931,0,What seems to be true in practice is that some case slots are in fact dependent but overwhelming majority of them are independent _comma_ due partly to the fact that usually only a few case slots are obligatory and most others are optional .
3303,0,This is mainly due to the clear theoretical and practical advantages of bidirectional grammar use Appelt 1987 .
4335,0,Therefore _comma_ we see no advantages to adopting their rule ; furthermore _comma_ they do not comment on what other laws have to be stipulated to account for the facts concerning other possible tense combinations .
5144,0,The grammar is divided into modules which filter out ungrammatical structures at the various levels of representation ; these levels are related by general transformations .
3440,0,Note that the fact _comma_ that this problematic case doesn't show up in the correct analysis of normal NL sentences _comma_ doesn't mean that a parser wouldn't have to try it _comma_ unless some arbitrary bound to that number is assumed .

2182,0,The solution given in this paper is to use a higher-order logic programming language _comma_  -Prolog _comma_ that already implements these concepts _comma_ called `` abstract syntax '' in Miller 1991 and `` higher-order abstract syntax '' in Pfenning and Elliot 1988 .
366,0,We present in this section the results of our research which has been implemented and in the next section _comma_ other directions which seems obviously promising .

2760,1,We study the computational complexity of the parsing problem of a variant of Lambek Categorial Grammar that we call semidirectional .
3439,0,That phonetic comparison is more precise is not particularly surprising _comma_ since etymon identity ignores a wealth of phonetic _comma_ phonological _comma_ and morphological data _comma_ whereas comparing phones has the side effect of also counting higher-level variation : if words differ in morphemes _comma_ their phonetic difference is going to be high .
1193,0,For example _comma_ if a natural language understanding system is interfaced with a speech recognition component _comma_ chances are that this compenent is uncertain about the actual string of words that has been uttered _comma_ and thus produces a word lattice of the most promising hypotheses _comma_ rather than a single sequence of words .
6056,0,The accuracy of the taggers on the 2_comma_215 unknown words when they were made known to the lexicon was much lower than in the previous experiment -- 90.3 % for the Xerox tagger and 91.5 % for Brill 's tagger .

4114,0,Also _comma_ it allows some flexibility in cases where pragmatics strongly suggests that quantifiers are copied and distributed for multiple extensional verbs ; unlike the Partee and Rooth account _comma_ this would apply equally to the case where there are also intensional verbs and the case where there are not .
3865,0,To decide what suggestion to make _comma_ the agent uses an instance of suggest-expand-plan _comma_ which has a mental action in its decomposition that chooses the attribute that he believes is the most salient that has not been used already .
6704,0,For example a speaker might use the expression `` so '' to signal that s / he is about to conclude what s / he has just said .

874,0,An adequate theory of ellipsis and event reference must account for this distinction .
5364,0,The optimal evaluation order of the right-hand side categories is found by comparing the maximal degree of nondeterminacy introduced by the evaluation of the individual categories with the degree of nondeterminacy the grammar is allowed to introduce : if the degree of nondeterminacy introduced by the evaluation of one of the right-hand side categories in a rule exceeds the admissible degree of nondeterminacy the ordering at hand is rejected .

1301,0,The overall reduction in error rate is small _comma_ from 21.4 % to 20.9 % _comma_ because the number of disagreements is small compared with the overall number of errors in our current recognition setup .
5244,0,We are concerned here with a particular fact about gapping noticed by Levin and Prince 1982 _comma_ namely that gapping is acceptable only with the purely conjunctive symmetric meaning of and conjoining the clauses _comma_ and not with its causal asymmetric meaning ( paraphraseable by `` and as a result '' ) .

2143,0,The precision of 74 % roughly can be interpreted as that for words which take on three different POS s in their POS - class _comma_ the ending-guessing rules will assign four _comma_ but in 95 % of the times ( recall ) the three required POS s will be among the four assigned by the guess .
4031,0,Unlike other approaches we don't require the corpus to be pre-annotated but use it in its raw form .
3790,0,However _comma_ State-Prediction can also apply _comma_ and can be instantiated in four ways ( these correspond to different ways of cutting up the left and right subcategorisation lists of the lexical entry _comma_ likes _comma_ i.e. as  np or np ) .

6967,0,We will call this system Partially Linear PATR ( PLPATR ) .
5825,0,The rules governing tense are :
370,0,The clauses for  and are the usual definitions of classical logic _comma_ thus we have all propositional calculus at our disposal ; as we shall see _comma_ this gives us the flexibility required to formulate non-trivial general constraints .
6505,0,In this sense _comma_ it is similar to the local organization techniques used in Sibun 1990 .

5575,0,However _comma_ the implementation issues _comma_ although more complex _comma_ are also well-understood and it can be expected that future work will bring further improvements .
459,0,It can be seen that first split separates the objects corresponding to the weaponry sense of `` fire '' ( cluster 1 ) from the ones corresponding to the personnel action ( cluster 2 ) .
1153,0,If the input structure for generation is provided by another AI-system _comma_ global problems in producing sufficient input information for the generator may occur _comma_ e.g. _comma_ because of translation mismatches in machine translation Kameyama 1991 .

6380,0,As INITIATIVE passes back and forth between the discourse participants _comma_ we say that CONTROL over the conversation gets transferred from one discourse participant to another .
6602,0,Therefore the proposed method translates it with the same number as the subject .
2854,0,Participants used certain types of signals when discourse goals were proceeding successfully but resorted to interruptions when they were not .
2659,0,So _comma_ for example _comma_ whether two terms with identical meanings are merely co-referential or are co-indexed is the kind of information that may get lost : the difference amounts to two ways of composing the same meaning .
3147,0,This says that if we are at a c-struct node which has at least one daughter ( that is _comma_ a non-terminal node ) then one of the subtree licensing disjuncts ( or ` rules ' ) must be satisfied there .

125,0,Elsewhere we show that
5393,0,We then use discriminant analysis _comma_ a technique from descriptive statistics .
7067,0,And there is no reason why the items characterizing the sentence have to be ( sequences of ) words ; occurrences of grammar rules _comma_ either without any context or in the context of _comma_ say _comma_ the rules occurring just above them in the parse tree _comma_ can be treated in just the same way .

4240,0,In order to obtain completeness in the general case _comma_ the inference schemata of the head-corner generator must be executed by a breadth-first interpreter _comma_ since a depth-first interpreter will loop if the semantic analysis rules admit that subtrees are associated with semantic forms which are not proper substructures of the input semantics _comma_ and if these subtrees can be composed recursively .

1708,0,Two comparisons are needed to show that the combination of distributional and phonotactic information performs better than either source alone : DIST-PHONO compared to RAND-PHONO _comma_ to see the effect of adding distributional analysis to phonotactic constraints _comma_ and DIST-PHONO compared to DIST-FREE _comma_ to see the effect of adding phonotactic constraints to distributional analysis .

2262,0,For each text we performed two tagging experiments .
3794,0,It is less brittle because statistical associations have replaced constraints ( featural _comma_ selectional _comma_ etc. ) that must be satisfied exactly .
3676,0,However _comma_ each essentially follows Sag in requiring that elided VP representations be alphabetic variants of their referents .
2635,0,This assures that the sentential symbol can expand to every symbol ; otherwise _comma_ adding a symbol will not affect the probabilities that the grammar assigns to strings .
5701,0,We then went on to analyse how control was exchanged between participants at the boundaries of these phases .
6154,0,For example  would be analysed as with a broken plural vocalism .
2382,0,Ordinarily _comma_ the input of such a system is a sequence of words .
3167,0,Hence _comma_ our algorithm should be less prone to suboptimal local minima than the Inside-Outside algorithm .
2502,0,The ith singular value can be interpreted as indicating the strength of the ith principal component of C.  and are orthonormal matrices that approximate the rows and columns of C _comma_ respectively .

3610,0,The superior performance of this model confirms results presented by Briscoe et al. 1994 _comma_ Merialdo 1994 _comma_ and Elworthy 1994 for English : empirically obtained initial values for transition and output probabilities with a small number of training iterations lead to significantly better results than intuitively generated biases do .
884,0,Psycholinguistic knowledge would be greatly helpful _comma_ as we believe _comma_ in constructing an artificial language processing system .

4269,0,To allow the above-mentioned types of information to mutually constrain each other _comma_ we employ a hierarchy of rhetorical and temporal relations ( illustrated in Figure  ) _comma_ using the ALE system in such a way that clues such as tense and cue words work together to reduce the number of possible temporal structures .

1951,0,The response to a suggestion depends _comma_ obviously _comma_ on whether or not the suggestion was used to expand the plan .
7265,0,The results suggest that a completely unconstrained initial model does not produce good quality results _comma_ and that one accurately trained from a hand-tagged corpus will generally do better than using an approach based on re-estimation _comma_ even when the training comes from a different source .

4174,0,Unfortunately _comma_ there are few corpora annotated with word sense information _comma_ and computing reliable statistics on word senses rather than words will require more data _comma_ rather than less .
812,0,However _comma_ clustering may also give us significant leverage in monolingual cases .
4212,0,However _comma_ on the subsequent input of hurts _comma_ the structure can be reanalysed by asserting an extra clausal node ( call it S  ) dominating NP ( which will then become the embedded subject ) _comma_ but which is in turn dominated by the matrix VP .
3078,0,In addition our methodology is different from other studies because we have attempted to provide an explanation for whole dialogues rather than fragments of dialogues _comma_ and used explicit criteria in a bottom-up manner to identify discourse structures .

7236,0,There is a need to incorporate some kind of generalized notion of linearity into such a system .
2390,0,For Siadhail _comma_ the ultimate scientific justification in adopting the three-dialect account is the fact that the Gaeltacht ( Irish-speaking territory ) is so fragmented nowadays that it no longer forms a continuum .

2636,0,If  is rational then for each feature structure F _comma_ F is satisfiable iff F has a resolvant .
5397,0,But in that case _comma_ it appears that checking the applicability of a production at some point in a derivation must entail the comparison of structures of unbounded size .
4562,0,Note that the tree shown in Figure  is unobtainable because the branch rooted at is dependent on more than one of the branches originating at its sibling .
6273,0,Harry 's assertion in  simply paraphrases what was said in and and so it cannot be adding beliefs to the common ground .

4672,0,We denote trees with first order terms .
2596,0,Now _comma_ in section  _comma_ we argued that no more than n - 1 rewrites would ever be necessary _comma_ thus the overall complexity of generation ( even when no solution is found ) is .

1165,0,Several researchers Partee 1984 _comma_ Hinrichs 1986 _comma_ Nerbonne 1986 _comma_ Webber 1988 have sought to explain the temporal relations induced by tense by treating it as anaphoric _comma_ drawing on Reichenbach 's separation between event _comma_ speech _comma_ and reference times Reichenbach 1947 .
5883,0,The concentration in early literature on using incremental interpretation for semantic filtering has perhaps distracted from some other applications which provide less controversial applications .

2589,0,This is important evidence for the main hypothesis of this paper : that enhancing a language model with clustering _comma_ which once the software is in place can be done largely automatically _comma_ can give us important clues about whether it is worth expending research _comma_ programming _comma_ data-collection and machine resources on hand-coded improvements to the way in which the language model in question models context _comma_ or whether those resources are best devoted to different _comma_ additional kinds of language model .
1989,0,Our work is related to research by Heid and Raab 1989 .

3091,0,My research suggests that this may be done by using string distances computed directly on phonetic transcriptions _comma_ and that this is better than restricting the study to lexical comparisons .
1988,0,However _comma_ they may well be constituents in other grammars .

7295,1,The current state of dialectometry thus presents two main questions which constitute the methodological focus of this paper .
1688,0,Moreover _comma_ they can utilise more of the implicit information in the training data by modelling negative relationships .
5924,0,But if a program is to catch such errors very soon after they are entered _comma_ it will have to operate with less than the complete sentence .

6453,1,In this paper _comma_ we have categorized several forms of ellipsis and event reference according to two features :
6934,0,It also suggests that semantics and isolated words need not play as central a role as one might think ( e.g._comma_ Jusczyk 1993 downplayed the utility of words in isolation ) .
3636,0,We assume that agents generally plan their actions to violate as few rules as possible _comma_ and so obligated actions will usually occur .
5211,0,We demonstrate our model on the Arabic verbal stems shown in  McCarthy 1981 .
4621,0,Since the description before the processing of the disambiguating word hurts is a subset of the final tree description _comma_ the monotonicity requirement is satisfied .
4469,0,As a guiding heuristic we will avoid formalisms that generate tree sets with an unbounded number of unbounded _comma_ dependent branches .
1875,0,which is  - equivalent to .
4410,0,The model is defined by two collections of parameters : the transition probabilities _comma_ which express the probability that a tag follows the preceding one ( or two for a second order model ) ; and the lexical probabilities _comma_ giving the probability that a word has a given tag without regard to words on either side of it .
6965,0,Since 1 is a unit element of F _comma_  .
3358,0,The supporting role of the grammatic framework and the prohibition filters should not be underestimated .
4739,0,They are categorized into three types as shown in Table  .

5283,0,Also _comma_ since none of these studies relate observed performance to that of other comparable parsing systems _comma_ implementational oversights may not be apparent and so be a confounding factor in any general conclusions made .
3935,0,Class construction is then combinatorially very demanding and depends on frequency counts for joint events involving particular words _comma_ a potentially unreliable source of information as we noted above .
6325,0,Tests of the system with small grammars have shown promising results _comma_ and a medium-scale HPSG for German is presently being implemented in GeLD .

5497,0,Firstly _comma_ we relax the stipulation that the items on the right hand side of the rules are strings _comma_ allowing them instead to be multisets .
59,0,Note that we allow the input to be a full FSA ( possibly including cycles _comma_ etc. ) since some of the above-mentioned techniques indeed result in cycles .

4759,0,For reasons of uncertainty of assumptions _comma_ incremental systems with this facility must be able to repair the default decision when the assumption turns out to be wrong by information given later .
7270,0,This means that it is difficult for the speaker to verify when an action has achieved its expected result _comma_ and so giving and receiving evidence is critical and the process of establishing mutual beliefs is carefully monitored by the conversants .
3761,0,However _comma_ as the evaluation below shows _comma_ good values for  are small _comma_ that is _comma_ the similarity-based model plays a stronger role than the independence assumption .

7242,0,For each  _comma_ is a semi-morph .
5407,0,the island associated with the rule as a whole extends from D to E and covers F items _comma_ where F is U + Q + T ;

5046,1,This experiment shows that an automatic procedure can reliably group a language into its dialect areas _comma_ starting from nothing more than phonetic transcriptions as commonly found in linguistic surveys .
1999,0,This success was directly measurable in terms of word recognition error rates _comma_ prompting language processing researchers to seek corresponding improvements in performance and robustness .
994,0,For example _comma_ consider :

1367,0,Next _comma_ each coordinate is changed into its deviation in the vector :
1127,0,FB assigns a probability to every tag on every word _comma_ while Viterbi prunes tags which cannot be chosen because their probability is lower than the ones of competing hypotheses _comma_ with a corresponding gain in computational efficiency .
157,0,Of course _comma_ sometimes it is possible to take advantage of certain cue words which either indicate or constrain the rhetorical relation .
1045,0,In such cases a simple top-down parser will be incomplete _comma_ and a left corner parser will resort to buffering the input ( so won't be fully word-by-word ) .
6010,0,Therefore it is important to distinguish an agent actually ACCEPTING the belief that p or intending to perform an action described by p from merely understanding that p was conveyed .
4809,0,The accuracy of the recovery in our robust parser is about 68 % - 77 % .
6212,0,However _comma_ intuitively _comma_ of the above sentences _comma_ it is only  which causes the conscious garden path effect .

7208,0,Firstly _comma_ consider conjuncts which correspond one to one in the categories of the corresponding words .
1064,0,The alternative proposed here is to view semantic interpretation as a process of building a ( possibly partial ) description of the intended semantic composition ; i.e. ( partial ) descriptions of what the meanings of various constituents are _comma_ and how they should be composed together .
6971,0,Since the types are identical _comma_ coordination can then take place .

7307,0,In section  it will be seen how the use of abstract syntax allows this to be expressed directly .
5275,0,Because of considerations like these _comma_ our aim in the implementation work was to treat tense _comma_ aspect _comma_ cue words and rhetorical relations as mutually constraining _comma_ with more specific information such as explicit cue words having higher priority than less specific information such as tense .
7185,0,Secondly _comma_ it makes only modest additional demands on training data .
6686,0,The examples in Section  showed how you can combine these analyses of focus with a variety of operators to convey a range of interpretations of the same sequence of words .
4420,0,Because our robust parser handle extragrammatical sentences with this syntactic information oriented recovery mechanism _comma_ it can be independent of a particular system or particular domain .
1147,0,The result of the learning process is a set of syntactic SRs _comma_ ( verb _comma_ syntactic relationship _comma_ semantic class ) .

2927,0,In German most of the effort is going into subclassification within major word classes _comma_ while in English and French a good deal of disambiguation work is devoted to separate major word classes .
5902,0,We in fact introduced some hierarchy into the endings : e.g. ment is shared by adverbs and nouns _comma_ while iquement is assigned to adverbs only .
1589,0,Another way of allowing pragmatic inferences to be cancelled is to assign them the status of defeasible information .
2507,0,For the following _comma_ we will focus on CoL verbs ( the Change of Location verbs ) _comma_ mainly because they are rich in spatiotemporal informations _comma_ but also because we have at disposal exhaustive lists of French CoL verbs .
4014,0,Therefore inflections are as follows : gar-re _comma_ gar-i _comma_ etc .
5672,0,The distinction between planned and unplanned behavior enables a very natural segmentation of the discourse into an attentional hierarchy .
5178,0,In other words _comma_ if only ( P _comma_ Q ) holds then P satisfies Q and nothing else does .
6028,0,However _comma_ since there is no popping of a stack _comma_ the full parsing history is available .

5447,0,Tense _comma_ aspect _comma_ rhetorical relations and temporal expressions affect the value of the RHET_RELN type that expresses the relationship between two DCUs : cue words are lexically marked according to what rhetorical relation they specify _comma_ and this relation is passed on to the DCU .
2017,0,In short _comma_ the second strategy is a ` divide and conquer ' strategy : treat structural issues using model theoretic tools _comma_ and procedural issues with ( revealing ) computational tools .
275,0,apply this method to disambiguate other syntactic structures such as dependency relations .
4645,0,with  _comma_ and with the focus set as the description ( including the semantic analysis ) of the focussed phrase man .

1228,0,These conclusions are based partly on an analysis of the mathematical properties of the clusters themselves _comma_ partly on how well they correlate with analyses based on more traditional isogloss techniques _comma_ and partly on how well they compare with previously-published descriptions of dialects in a specific language _comma_ Irish Gaelic .
5123,0,Registering all compound nouns in a dictionary is an impractical approach _comma_ since we can create a new compound noun by combining nouns .

2049,0,However _comma_ for some interesting cases _comma_ such as a Combinatory Categorial Grammar account of coordination constructs _comma_ this can only be done by obscuring the underlying linguistic theory with the `` tricks '' needed for implementation .
5471,1,While it may be worthwhile to base such a model on preexisting sense classes Resnik 1992 _comma_ in the work described here we look at how to derive the classes directly from distributional data .
3763,0,Note that van Noord 's method is restricted to grammars where phrases have always a lexical semantic head .

6171,0,For example _comma_ if  represents a simple past eventive sentence and a past perfect eventive sentence _comma_ then in spite of the lack of rhetorical cues we know that e precedes e _comma_ as in :
3945,1,In this paper _comma_ we only consider events and states _comma_ together termed eventualities in Bach 1981 .

6985,0,In this case _comma_ the resolution of the anaphora is postponed to a next call of the anaphora module according to principle  stated above .
4794,0,However _comma_ her model focuses on determining when to include informationally redundant utterances _comma_ whereas our model determines whether or not justification is needed for a claim to be convincing and _comma_ if so _comma_ selects appropriate evidence from the system 's private beliefs to support the claim .
